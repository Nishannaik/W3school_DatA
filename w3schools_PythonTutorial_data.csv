Python ,Scope,"Local Scope,Global Scope,Global Keyword","Example,Example,Example,Example,Example,Example","A variable is only available from inside the region it is 
created. This is called ,.,A variable created inside a function belongs to the , of 
that function, and can only be used inside that function.,As explained in the example above, the variable , is not available outside the function, 
but it is available for any function inside the function:,A variable created in the main body of the Python code is a global variable 
and belongs to the global scope.,Global variables are available from within any scope, global and local.,If you operate with the same variable name inside and outside of a function, Python will treat them as two 
separate variables,
one available in the global scope (outside the function) and one available in the local scope (inside the function):,If you need to create a global variable, but are stuck in the local scope, you can use the 
, keyword.,The , keyword makes the variable global.,Also, use the , keyword if you want to 
make a change to a global variable inside a function.",,,
Python ,Iterators,"Python Iterators,Iterator vs Iterable,Looping Through an Iterator,Create an Iterator,StopIteration","Example,Example,Example,Example,Example,Example","An iterator is an object that contains a countable number of values.,An iterator is an object that can be iterated upon, meaning that you can 
traverse through all the values.,Technically, in Python, an iterator is an object which implements the 
iterator protocol, which consist of the methods , 
and ,.,Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are all iterable objects. They are iterable
, which you can get an iterator from.,All these objects have a , method which is used to get an iterator:,Even strings are iterable objects, and can return an iterator:,We can also use a , loop to iterate through an iterable object:,The , loop actually creates an iterator object and executes the next() 
method for each loop.,To create an object/class as an iterator you have to implement the methods
, and , to your object.,As you have learned in the , chapter, all classes have a function called
,, which allows you to do some 
initializing when the object is being created.,The , method acts similar, you can 
do operations (initializing etc.), but must always return the iterator object 
itself.,The , method also allows you to do 
operations, and must return the next item in the sequence.,The example above would continue forever if you had enough next() statements, or if it was used in a 
, loop.,To prevent the iteration to go on forever, we can use the 
, statement.,In the , method, we can add a terminating condition to raise an error if the iteration is done a specified number of times:",,,

Python ,Inheritance,"Python Inheritance,Create a Parent Class,Create a Child Class,Add the __init__() Function,Use the super() Function,Add Properties,Add Methods","Example,Example,Example,Example,Example,Example,Example,Example,Example","Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class., is the class being inherited from, also called 
base class., is the class that inherits from another class, 
also called derived class.,Any class can be a parent class, so the syntax is the same as creating any 
other class:,To create a class that inherits the functionality from another class, send the parent class as a parameter when creating the child 
class:,Now the Student class has the same properties and methods as the Person 
class.,So far we have created a child class that inherits the properties and methods 
from its parent.,We want to add the , function to the child class (instead of the , keyword).,When you add the , function, the child class will no longer inherit 
the parent's , function.,To keep the inheritance of the parent's , 
function, add a call to the 
parent's , function:,Now we have successfully added the __init__() function, and kept the 
inheritance of the parent class, and we are ready to add functionality in the
, function.,Python also has a , function that 
will make the child class inherit all the methods and properties from its 
parent:,By using the , function, you do not 
have to use the name of the parent element, it will automatically inherit the 
methods and properties from its parent.,In the example below, the year , should be a variable, and passed into the 
, class when creating student objects.
To do so, add another parameter in the __init__() function:,If you add a method in the child class with the same name as a function in 
the parent class, the inheritance of the parent method will be overridden.",,,

keyword:,To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis:,Information can be passed into functions as arguments.,Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses.
You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma.,
The following example has a function with one argument (fname).
When the function is called, we pass along a first name,
which is used inside the function to print the full name:
,The terms , and , can be used for the same thing: information that are passed into a function.,By default, a function must be called with the correct number of arguments. 
Meaning that if your function expects 2 arguments, you have to call the function 
with 2 arguments, not more, and not less. ,If you do not know how many arguments that will be passed into your function,
add a , before the parameter name in the function definition.,This way the function will receive a , of arguments, and can access the items accordingly:,You can also send arguments with the , = , syntax.,This way the order of the arguments does not matter.,If you do not know how many keyword arguments that will be passed into your function,
add two asterisk: , before the parameter name in the function definition.,This way the function will receive a , of arguments, and can access the items accordingly:,The following example shows how to use a default parameter value.,If we call the function without argument, it uses the default value:,You can send any data types of argument to a function (string, number, list, dictionary etc.), 
and it will
be treated as the same data type inside the function.,E.g. if you send a List as an argument, it will still be a List when it 
reaches the function:,To let a function return a value, use the , 
statement:, definitions cannot be empty, but if 
you for some reason have a , definition with no content, put in the , statement to avoid getting an error.,Python also accepts function recursion, which means a defined function can call itself.,Recursion is a common mathematical and programming concept. It means that a function calls itself. This has the benefit of meaning that you can loop through data to reach a result.,The developer should be very careful with recursion as it can be quite easy to slip into writing a function which never terminates, or one that uses excess amounts of memory or processor power. However, when written correctly recursion can be a very efficient and mathematically-elegant approach to programming.,In this example, , is a function that we have defined to call itself (""recurse""). We use the , variable as the data, which decrements (,) every time we recurse. The recursion ends when the condition is not greater than 0 (i.e. when it is 0).,To a new developer it can take some time to work out how exactly this works, best way to find out is by testing and modifying it.",,,

regression, even though it would give us some weird results if we try to predict 
values outside of the data set. Example: the line indicates that a customer 
spending 6 minutes in the shop would make a purchase worth 200. That is probably 
a sign of overfitting.,But what about the R-squared score? The R-squared score is a good indicator 
of how well my data set is fitting the model.,Remember R2, also known as R-squared?,It measures the relationship between the x axis and the y 
axis, and the value ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 means no relationship, and 1 
means totally related.,The sklearn module has a method called ,

for volume against CO2. The answer(s) we get tells us what would happen if we 
increase, or decrease, one of the independent values.,The result array represents the coefficient values of weight and volume.,Weight: 0.00755095,

emission increases by 0.00755095g.,And if the engine size (Volume) increases by 1 cm,, the CO2 emission 
increases by 0.00780526 g.,I think that is a fair guess, but let test it!,We have already predicted that if a car with a 1300cm, engine weighs 2300kg, the CO2 emission will be approximately 107g.,What if we increase the weight with 1000kg?,
We have predicted that a car with 1.3 liter engine, and a weight of

are very important.,NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.,This behavior is called locality of reference in computer science.,This is the main reason why NumPy is faster than lists. Also it is optimized to work with latest CPU architectures.,NumPy is a Python library and is written partially in Python, but most of the parts that require fast computation are written in C or C++.,The source code for NumPy is located at this github repository

SciPy ,Sparse Data,"What is Sparse Data,How to Work With Sparse Data,CSR Matrix,Sparse Matrix Methods","Example,Example,Example,Example,Example,Example","Sparse data is data that has mostly unused elements (elements that don't carry any information ).,It can be an array like this one:,In scientific computing, when we are dealing with partial derivatives in linear algebra we will come across sparse data.,SciPy has a module, ,
that provides functions to deal with sparse data.,There are primarily two types of sparse matrices that we use:, - Compressed Sparse Column. For efficient arithmetic, 
fast column slicing., - Compressed Sparse Row. For fast row slicing, faster 
matrix vector products,We will use the ,matrix in this tutorial.,We can create CSR matrix by passing an arrray into function ,.,The example above returns:,Viewing stored data (not the zero items) with the , property:,Counting nonzeros with the , method:,Removing zero-entries from the matrix with the , method:,Eliminating duplicate entries with the , method:,Converting from csr to csc with the , method:",,,
SciPy ,Quiz,"The Test,Count Your Score",,"You can test your SciPy skills with W3Schools' Quiz.,The test contains 25 questions and there is no time limit.,The test is not official, it's just a nice way to see how much you know, or don't know, about 
SciPy.,You will get 1 point for each correct answer. At the end of the Quiz,
your total score will be displayed. Maximum score is 25 points.",,,
Python ,Data Types,"Built-in Data Types,Getting the Data Type,Setting the Data Type,Setting the Specific Data Type",Example,"In programming, data type is an important concept.,Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do 
different things.,Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:,You can get the data type of any object by using the , function:,In Python, the data type is set when you assign a value to a variable:,If you want to specify the data type, you can use the following 
constructor functions:",,,
Python ,Syntax,"Python Indentation,Python Variables,Comments","Example,Example,Example,Example","Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line:,Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.,Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability 
only, the indentation in Python is very important.,Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.,Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:,The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, but it has 
to be at least one.,You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, 
otherwise Python will give you an error:,In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:
,Python has no command for declaring a variable.,You will learn more about variables in the , chapter.,Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.,Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:

Python ,Getting Started,"Python Install,Python Quickstart,The Python Command Line",,"Many PCs and Macs will have python already installed.,To check if you have python installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Python or run the following on the Command Line (cmd.exe):,To check if you have python installed on a Linux or Mac, then on linux open the command line or on Mac open the Terminal and type:,If you find that you do not have Python installed on your computer, then you can download it for free from the following website: ,Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a developer you write Python (.py) files in a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed.,The way to run a python file is like this on the command line:,Where ""helloworld.py"" is the name of your python file.,Let's write our first Python file, called helloworld.py, which can be done in any text editor.,Simple as that. Save your file. Open your command line, navigate to the directory where you saved your file, and run:,The output should read:,Congratulations, you have written and executed your first Python program.,To test a short amount of code in python sometimes it is quickest and easiest not to write the code in a file. This is made possible because Python can be run as a command line itself.,Type the following on the Windows, Mac or Linux command line:,From there you can write any python, including our hello world example from earlier in the tutorial:,Which will write ""Hello, World!"" in the command line:,Whenever you are done in the python command line, you can simply type the following to quit the python command line interface:",,,
Python ,Introduction,What is Python?,Example,"Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, 
and released in 1991.,It is used for:","web development (server-side), ,software development, ,mathematics,,system scripting.,Python can be used on a server to create web applications.,Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.,Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.,Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.,Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.,Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).,Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.,Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.,Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.,Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.,The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.,In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.,Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.,Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.,Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.",,
Python ,Variables,"Varia,l,Creating Variables,Casting,Get the Type,Single or Double Quotes?,Case-Sensitive","Example,Example,Example,Example,Example,Example","Variables are containers for storing data values.,Python has no command for declaring a variable.,A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.,Variables do not need to be declared with any particular ,, and can even change type after they have been set.,If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.,You can get the data type of a variable with the , function.,String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:,Variable names are case-sensitive.",,,
Python ,Comments,"Creating a Comment,Multi Line Comments","Example,Example,Example,Example,Example","Comments can be used to explain Python code.,Comments can be used to make the code more readable.,Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.,Comments starts with a ,, and Python will 
ignore them:,Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest 
of the line:,A comment does not have to be text that explains the code, it can also be used to 
prevent Python from executing code:,Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments.,To add a multiline comment you could insert a , for each line:,Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.,Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:,As long as the string is not assigned to a variable, Python will read the code, but then ignore it, and you have made a multiline comment.",,,
