jQuery - ,Chaining,jQuery Method Chaining,"Example,Example","With jQuery, you can chain together actions/methods.,Chaining allows us to run multiple jQuery methods (on the same 
element) within a single statement.,Until now we have been writing jQuery statements one at a time (one after the 
other).,However, there is a technique called chaining, that 
allows us to run multiple jQuery commands, one after the other, on the same 
element(s)., This way, browsers do not have to find the same element(s) more than once.,To chain 
an action, you simply append the action to the previous action. ,The following example chains together the ,, ,, and , 
methods. The ""p1"" element first changes to red, then it slides up, and then it 
slides down: ,We could also have added more method calls if needed.,: When chaining, the line of code 
could become quite long. However, jQuery is not very strict on the syntax; you can format it like you want, including line breaks and indentations. ,This also works just fine:,jQuery throws away extra whitespace and executes the lines above as one long line of code.",,,
jQuery ,Get Started,"Adding jQuery to Your Web Pages,Downloading jQuery,jQuery CDN",Google CDN:,"There are several ways to start using jQuery on your web site. You can:,There are two versions of jQuery available for downloading: ,Both versions can be downloaded from ,.,The jQuery library is a single JavaScript file, and you reference it with the HTML , tag 
(notice that the , tag should be inside the , section):, Place the downloaded file in the same directory as the pages where you wish to use it.,
,If you don't want to download and host jQuery yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).,Google is an example of someone who host jQuery:","Download the jQuery library from jQuery.com,Include jQuery from a CDN, like Google,Production version - this is for your live website because it has been minified and compressed,Development version - this is for testing and development (uncompressed and readable code)","

jQuery ,Introduction,"What You Should Already Know,What is jQuery?,Why jQuery?",,"The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.,Before you start studying jQuery, you should have a basic knowledge of:,If you want to study these subjects first, find the tutorials on our ,.,jQuery is a lightweight, ""write less, do more"", JavaScript library.,The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.,jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish,
and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.,jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.,The jQuery library contains the following features:, In addition, jQuery has plugins for almost any task out there.,There are lots of other JavaScript libraries out there, but jQuery
is probably the most popular, and also the most extendable.,Many of the biggest companies on the Web use jQuery, such as:","HTML/DOM manipulation,CSS manipulation,HTML event methods,Effects and animations,AJAX,Utilities,Google,Microsoft,IBM,Netflix",,
"jQuery , Functions",Callback,jQuery Callback Functions,"Example with Callback,Example without Callback","A callback function is executed after the current effect is 100% finished.,JavaScript statements are executed line by line. However, with effects, 
the next line of code can be run even though the effect is not finished. This 
can create errors.,To prevent this, you can create a callback function.,A callback function is executed after the current effect is finished.,Typical syntax: ,The example below has a callback parameter that is a function that will be executed after the hide effect is completed:,The example below has no callback parameter, and the alert box will be displayed before the hide effect is completed:",,,
jQuery ,Syntax,"jQuery Syntax,The Document Ready Event",,"With jQuery you select (query) HTML elements and perform ""actions"" on them.,The jQuery syntax is tailor-made for , HTML elements and performing some , on the element(s).,Basic syntax is: ,Examples:, - hides the current element., - hides all <p> elements., - hides all elements with class=""test""., - hides the element with id=""test"".,You might have noticed that all jQuery methods in our examples, are inside a document ready event:,This is to prevent any jQuery code from running before the document is finished loading (is ready).,It is good practice to wait for the document to be fully loaded and ready before working with it.
This also allows you to have your JavaScript code before the body of your document, in the head section. ,Here are some examples of actions that can fail if methods are run before the document is fully loaded:, The jQuery team has also created an even shorter method for the 
document ready event:,Use the syntax you prefer. We think that the document ready event is easier to understand when reading the code.","A $ sign to define/access jQuery,A (,) to ""query (or find)"" HTML elements,A jQuery ,() to be performed on the element(s),Trying to hide an element that is not created yet,Trying to get the size of an image that is not loaded yet",,
jQuery ,Selectors,"jQuery Selectors,The element Selector,The #id Selector,The .class Selector,More Examples of jQuery Selectors,Functions In a Separate File,jQuery Exercises","Example,Example,Example,Example","jQuery selectors are one of the most important parts of the jQuery library.,jQuery selectors allow you to select and manipulate HTML element(s).,jQuery selectors are used to ""find"" (or select) HTML elements based on their 
name, id, classes, types, attributes, values of attributes and much more.
It's based on the existing ,, and in addition, it has 
some own custom selectors.,All selectors in jQuery start with the dollar sign and parentheses: $().,The jQuery element selector selects elements based on the element name.,You can select all , elements on a page like this:,When a user clicks on a button, all , elements will be hidden:,The jQuery , selector uses the id attribute of an HTML tag to find the specific element.,An id should be unique within a page, so you should use the #id selector when you want to find a single, unique element.,To find an element with a specific id, write a hash character, followed by the id of the 
HTML element:,When a user clicks on a button, the element with id=""test"" will be hidden:,The jQuery , selector finds elements with a specific class.,To find elements with a specific class, write a period character, followed by the name of the class:,When a user clicks on a button, the elements with class=""test"" will be hidden:,Use our , to demonstrate the different selectors.,For a complete reference of all the jQuery selectors, please go to our ,.,If your website contains a lot of pages, and you want your jQuery functions to be easy 
to maintain, you can put your jQuery functions in a separate .js file.,When we demonstrate jQuery in this tutorial, the functions are added directly into the , 
section. However, sometimes it is preferable to place them in a separate file, like this (use 
the src attribute to refer 
to the .js file): ",,"
