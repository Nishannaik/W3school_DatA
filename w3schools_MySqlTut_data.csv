 ,MySQL Data Types,MySQL Data Types (Version 8.0),,"The data type of a column defines what value the column can hold: 
integer, character, money, date and time, binary, 
and so on.,Each column in a database table is required to have a name and a data type.,An SQL developer must decide what type of data that will be stored inside each 
column when creating a table. The data type is a 
guideline for SQL to understand what type of data is expected inside of each 
column, and it also identifies how SQL will interact with the stored data.,In MySQL there are three main data types: string, numeric, and date and time., All the numeric data types may have an extra option: UNSIGNED 
or ZEROFILL. If you add the UNSIGNED option, MySQL disallows negative values for 
the column. If you add the ZEROFILL option, MySQL automatically also adds the 
UNSIGNED attribute to the column.",,,
