Statistics - Describing Data,,Descriptive Statistics,,"Describing data is typically the second step of statistical analysis after gathering data.,The information (data) from your sample or population can be visualized with graphs or , by numbers. This will show key information in a simpler way than just looking at raw data. It can help us understand how the data is ,.,Graphs can visually show the data distribution.,Examples of graphs include:,Some graphs have a close connection to numerical summary statistics. Calculating those gives us the basis of these graphs.,For example, a box plot visually shows the , of a data distribution.,Quartiles are the data split into four equal size parts, or quarters. A quartile is one type of summary statistics.,Summary statistics take a large amount of information and sums it up in a few key values.,Numbers are calculated from the data which also describe the shape of the distributions. These are individual 'statistics'.,Some important examples are:", and ,,
Statistics - Gathering Data,,Gathering Data,,"Gathering data is the first step in statistical analysis.,Say for example that you want to know something about ,.,The , is then all of the people in France.,It is too much effort to gather information about all of the members of a population (e.g. all 67+ million people living in France). It is often much easier to collect a smaller group of that population and analyze that. This is called a ,.
,The sample needs to be , to the whole population of France. It should have the same characteristics as the population. If you only include people named Jacques living in Paris who are 48 years old, the sample will not be similar to the whole population.
,So for a good sample, you will need people from all over France, with different ages, professions, and so on.,If the members of the sample have similar characteristics (like age, profession, etc.) to the whole population of France, we say that the sample is , of the population.,A good , is crucial for statistical methods.",,,
Statistics - Populations and Samples,,Population and Samples,,"The terms 'population' and 'sample' are important in statistics and refer to key concepts that are closely related.,: Everything in the group that we want to learn about.,: A part of the population.,Examples of populations and a sample from those populations:,For good statistical analysis, the sample needs to be as ""similar"" as possible to the population. If they are similar enough, we say that the sample is , of the population.
,The sample is used to make conclusions about the whole population. If the sample is not similar enough to the whole population, the conclusions could be useless.",,,
Statistics - Prediction and Explanation,,"Prediction,Explanation",,"Some types of statistical methods are focused on predicting what will happen.,Other types of statistical methods are focused on explaining how things are connected.,Some statistical methods are not focused on explaining how things are connected. Only the accuracy of prediction is important.,Many statistical methods are successful at predicting without giving insight into how things are connected.,Some types of machine learning let computers do the hard work, but the way they predict is difficult to understand. These approaches can also be vulnerable to mistakes if the circumstances change, since the how they work is less clear.,Different statistical methods are often used for explaning how things are connected. These statistical methods may not make good predictions. ,These statistical methods often explain only small parts of the whole situation. But, if you only want to know how a few things are connected, the rest might not matter.,If these methods accurately explains how all the relevant things are connected, they will also be good at prediction. But managing to explain every detail is often challenging.,Some times we are specifically interested in figuring out if one thing causes another. This is called ,.,If we are looking at complicated situations, many things are connected. To figure out what causes what, we need to untangle every way these things are connected.",,,
Statistics Introduction,,"What is Statistics Used for?,Typical Steps of Statistical Methods,How is Statistics Used?,Important Concepts in Statistics,Statistics and Programming",,"Statistics gives us methods of gaining knowledge from data.,Statistics is used in all kinds of science and business applications.,Statistics gives us more accurate knowledge which helps us make better decisions.,Statistics can focus on making , about what will happen in the future. It can also focus on , how different things are connected.,It is important to keep all three steps in mind for any questions we want more knowledge about.,Knowing which types of data are available can tell you what kinds of questions you can answer with statistical methods.,Knowing which questions you want to answer can help guide what sort of data you need. A lot of data might be available, and knowing what to focus on is important.,Statistics can be used to explain things in a precise way. You can use it to understand and make conclusions about the group that you want to know more about. This group is called the ,.,A population could be many different kinds of groups. It could be:,and so on - it just depends on what you want to know about.,Gathering data about the population will give you a ,. This is a part of the whole population. Statistical methods are then used on that sample.,The results of the statistical methods from the sample is used to make , about the population.,We will cover these topics step by step in this tutorial.,Statistical analysis is typically done with computers. Small amounts of data can analyzed reasonably well 
without computers.,Historically, all data analysis was performed by manually. It was time-consuming and prone to errors.,Nowadays, programming and software is typically used for data analysis.,In this course, we will show examples of code to do statistics with the programming languages Python and R.","Gathering data,Describing and visualizing data,Making conclusions,All of the people in a country,All the businesses in an industry,All the customers of a business,All people that play football who are older than 45,Predictions and Explanations,Populations and Samples,Parameters and Sample Statistics,Sampling Methods,Data Types,Measurement Level,Descriptive Statistics,Random Variables,Univariate and Multivariate Statistics,Probability Calculation,Probability Distributions,Statistical Inference,Parameter Estimation,Hypothesis Testing,Correlation,Regression Analysis,Causal Inference",,
