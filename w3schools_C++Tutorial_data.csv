C++ ,Functions,"Create a Function,Call a Function,Function Declaration and Definition","Syntax,Example,Example,Example","A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.,You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.,Functions are used to perform certain actions, and they are 
important for reusing code: Define the code once, and use it many times.,C++ provides some pre-defined 
functions, such as ,, which is used to 
execute code. But you can also 
create your own functions to perform certain actions. ,To create (often referred to as ,) a function, specify the name of the function, followed by parentheses ,: ,Declared functions are not executed immediately. They are ""saved for later 
use"", and will be executed later, when they are called.,To call a function, write the function's name followed by two parentheses , 
and a semicolon ,In the following example, , is used to print a text (the action), when it is called:,A function can be called multiple times:,A C++ function consist of two parts:, If a user-defined function, such as , is declared after the , function, 
,:,However, it is possible to separate the declaration and the definition of the function - for code optimization.,You will often see C++ programs that have function declaration above ,, 
and function definition below ,. This will make the code 
better organized and easier to read:"," is the name of the function, means that the function does not have a 
return value. You will learn more about return values later in the next chapter,inside the function (the body), add code that defines what the function should do, the return type, the name of the function, and parameters (if any), the body of the function (code to be executed)",,
C++ ,Pointers,Creating Pointers,"Example,Example","You learned from the previous chapter, that we can get the , of a variable by using the , 
operator:,A , however, is a variable that ,. ,A pointer variable points to a data type (like , or ,) of the same 
type, and is created with the , operator. The address of the variable you're working with is assigned to the pointer:,Create a pointer variable with the name ,, that , a , variable, by using the 
asterisk sign 
, (,). 
Note that the type of the pointer has to match the type of the variable you're 
working with.,Use the , operator to store the memory address of the 
variable called ,, and assign it to the pointer.,Now, , holds the value of ,'s memory address.",,,
C++ ,References,Creating References,Example,"A reference variable is a ""reference"" to an existing variable, and 
it is created with the , operator:,Now, we can use either the variable name , or the reference name , 
to refer to the , variable:",,,
C++ ,Classes and Objects,"C++ Classes/Objects,Create a Class,Create an Object,Multiple Objects","Example,Example,Example","C++ is an object-oriented programming language.,Everything in C++ is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and 
methods. For example: in real life, a car is an ,. The car has ,, such as weight and color, and ,, such as drive and brake.,Attributes and methods are basically , and , that belongs to the class. These are often referred to as 
""class members"".,A class is a user-defined data type that we can use in our program, and it 
works as an object constructor, or a ""blueprint"" for creating objects.,To create a class, use the , keyword:,In C++, an object is created from a class. We have already created the class named ,, 
so now we can use this to create objects.,To create an object of ,, specify the 
class name, followed by the object name.,To access the class attributes (, and ,), use the dot syntax (,) 
on the object:,You can create multiple objects of one class:","The , keyword is used to create a class called ,.,The , keyword is an ,, which specifies that members (attributes and methods) of the class are accessible from outside the class. You will learn more about , later.,Inside the class, there is an integer variable , and a string variable ,. When variables are declared 
within a class, they are called ,.,At last, end the class definition with a semicolon ,.",,
C++ ,Class Methods,"Class Methods,Parameters","Inside Example,Outside Example,Â Example","Methods are , that belongs to the class.,There are two ways to define functions that belongs to a class:,In the following example, we define a function inside the class, and we name 
it "",""., You access methods just like you access attributes; by creating an object of 
the class and using the dot syntax (,):,To define a function outside the class definition, you have to declare it 
inside the class and then define it outside of the class. This is done by specifiying the 
name of the class, followed the scope resolution , operator, 
followed by the name of the function:,You can also add parameters:","Inside class definition,Outside class definition",,
C++ ,OOP,"C++ What is OOP?,C++ What are Classes and Objects?",,"OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.,Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform 
operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about 
creating objects that contain both data and functions.,Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural 
programming:, The ""Don't Repeat Yourself"" (DRY) principle is about 
reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are 
common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them 
instead of repeating it.,Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.,Look at the following illustration to see the difference between class and 
objects:,Another example:,So, a class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.,When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the 
variables and functions from the class.,You will learn much more about , in the next chapter.","OOP is faster and easier to execute,OOP provides a clear structure for the programs,OOP helps to keep the C++ code DRY ""Don't Repeat Yourself"", and makes 
  the 
  code easier to maintain, modify and debug,OOP makes it possible to create full reusable 
  applications with less code and shorter development time",,
C++ ,Function Parameters,Parameters and Arguments,"Syntax,Example","Information can be passed to functions as a parameter. Parameters act as 
variables inside the function.,Parameters are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses.
You can add as many parameters as you want, just separate them with a comma:,
The following example has a 
function that takes a , called , as parameter.
When the function is called, we pass along a first name,
which is used inside the function to print the full name:
",,,
C++ ,Function Overloading,Function Overloading,"Example,Example,Example","With,, multiple functions can have the same name with different
parameters:,Consider the following example, which have two functions that add numbers of different type:,Instead of defining two functions that should do the same thing, it is better to overload one. ,In the example below, we overload the , function to work for both , 
and ,:",,,
C++ ,Break and Continue,"C++ Break,C++ Continue,Break and Continue in While Loop","Example,Example,Break Example,Continue Example","You have already seen the , statement used in an earlier chapter of this tutorial. It was used to ""jump out"" of a , statement.,The , statement can also be used to jump out of a 
,.,This example jumps out of the loop when , is equal to 4:,The , statement breaks one iteration (in the loop), if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.,This example skips the value of 4:,You can also use , and , in while loops:",,,
C++ ,Constructors,"Constructors,Constructor Parameters","Example,Example,Example","A constructor in C++ is a , that is 
automatically called when an object of a class is created.,To create a constructor, use the same name as the class, followed by 
parentheses ,:,Constructors can also take parameters (just like regular functions), which can be 
useful for setting initial values for attributes.,The following class have ,, , and , attributes, and a constructor with 
different parameters. Inside the constructor we set the attributes equal to the 
constructor parameters (,, etc). When we call the constructor 
(by creating an object of the class), we pass parameters to the constructor, which will set the value of 
the corresponding attributes to the same:,Just like functions, constructors can also be defined outside the class. 
First, declare the constructor inside the class, and then define it outside of the 
class by specifying the name of the class, followed by the scope resolution , 
operator, followed by the name of the constructor (which is the same as the 
class):",,,
C++ ,Access Specifiers,Access Specifiers,"Example,Example,Example","By now, you are quite familiar with the , keyword that appears in all of our class examples:,The , keyword is an , 
Access specifiers define how the members (attributes and methods) of a class can 
be accessed. In the example above, the members are , - which means that they 
can be accessed and modified from outside the code. ,However, what if we want 
members to be private and hidden from the outside world? ,In C++, there are three access specifiers:,In the following example, we demonstrate the differences between , and , members:, By default, all members of a class are , if you don't specify an access specifier:"," - members are accessible from outside the class, - members cannot be accessed (or 
viewed) from outside the class, - members cannot be accessed from 
outside the class, however, they can be accessed in inherited classes. You will learn more about , later.",,

5). If the condition is true, the loop will start over again, if it is false, 
the loop will end.,Statement 3 increases a value (i++) each time the code block in the loop has 
been executed.,This example will only print even values between 0 and 10:",,,
C++ ,While Loop,"C++ Loops,C++ While Loop","Syntax,Example","Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.,Loops are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and they make code more readable.,The , loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is ,:,In the example below, the code in the loop will run, over and over again, as long as 
a variable (,) is less than 5:",,,
C++ ,Arrays,"C++ Arrays,Access the Elements of an Array,Change an Array Element","Example,Example,Example","Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each 
value.,To declare an array, define the variable type, specify the name 
of the array followed by , 
and specify the number of elements it should store:,We have now declared a variable that holds an array of four strings. To insert 
values to it, we can use an array literal - place the values in a 
comma-separated list, inside curly braces:,To create an array of three integers, you could write:,You access an array element by referring to the index number.,This statement accesses the value of the , in 
,:,To change the value of a specific element, refer to the index number:",,,
C++ ,Switch,"C++ Switch Statements,The break Keyword,The default Keyword","Syntax,Example,Example","Use the , statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.,This is how it works:,The example below uses the weekday number to calculate the weekday name:,When C++ reaches a , 
keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.,This will stop the execution of more code and case testing inside 
the block.,When a match is found, and the job is done, it's time for a break. There is no need for more testing.,The , keyword specifies some code to run if there is no 
case match:","The , expression is evaluated once,The value of the expression is compared with the values of each ,If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed,The , and , keywords are optional, and will be described later in this chapter",,

sum by calculating (adding) the two numbers:",,,
C++ ,Inheritance,Inheritance,Example,"In C++, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. We group the ""inheritance concept"" into two categories:,To inherit from a class, use the , symbol.,In the example below, the , class 
(child) inherits the attributes and methods from the , class 
(parent):"," (child) - the class that inherits from another class, (parent) - the class being inherited from",,
C++ ,Encapsulation,"Encapsulation,Access Private Members,Why Encapsulation?",Example,"The meaning of ,, is to make sure that 
""sensitive"" data is hidden from users. To achieve this, you must declare class variables/attributes as , (cannot 
be accessed from outside the class). If you want others to read or modify the 
value of a private member, you can provide public , and 
, methods.,To access a private attribute, use public ""get"" and ""set"" methods:,The , attribute is ,, 
which have restricted access.,The public , method takes a parameter (,) and assigns it to the
, attribute (salary = s).,The public , method returns the value of 
the private , attribute.,Inside ,, we create an object of the , class. Now we can use the 
, method to set the value of the 
private attribute to ,. Then we call the 
, method on the object to return the value.","It is considered good practice to declare your class attributes as private (as 
often as you can). Encapsulation ensures better control of your data, 
because you (or others) can change one part of the code without affecting other parts,Increased security of data",,
C++ ,If ... Else,"C++ Conditions and If Statements,The if Statement","Syntax,Example,Example","C++ supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:,You can use these conditions to perform different actions for different decisions.,C++ has the following conditional statements:,Use the , statement to specify a block of 
C++ code to be executed if a condition is ,.,In the example below, we test two values to find out if 20 is greater than 
18. If the condition is ,, print some text:,We can also test variables:,In the example above we use two variables, , and ,, 
to test whether x is greater than y 
(using the , operator). As x is 20, and y is 18, and we know that 20 is greater than 18, we print to the screen that ""x is greater than y"".","Less than: ,Less than or equal to: ,Greater than: ,Greater than or equal to: ,Equal to ,Not Equal to: ,Use , to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true,Use , to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false,Use , to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false,Use , to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed",,
C++ ,Exceptions,"C++ Exceptions,C++ try and catch,Handle Any Type of Exceptions (...)","Example,Example,Example,Example,Example","When executing C++ code, different errors can occur: coding errors made by the programmer, errors due to wrong input, 
or other unforeseeable things.,When an error occurs, C++ will normally stop and generate an error message. The technical term for this is: C++ will throw an , (throw an error).,Exception handling in C++ consist of three keywords: ,, , and ,:,The , statement allows you to define a block of code to be 
tested for errors while it is being executed.,The , keyword throws an exception when a 
problem is detected, which lets us create a custom error.,The , statement allows you to define a block of code to 
be executed, if an error occurs in the try block.,The , and , keywords 
come in pairs:,Consider the following example:,We use the , block to test some code: If the , variable is less than ,, we will , an exception, and handle it in our , block.,In the , block, we catch the error and 
do something about it. The , 
statement takes a ,: in our example we use an , variable (,) (because we are throwing an exception of , type in the , block (,)), 
to output the value of ,.,If no error occurs (e.g. if , is , instead of ,, 
meaning it will be be greater 
than 18), the , block is skipped:,You can also use the , keyword to output a reference number, like a 
custom error number/code for organizing purposes:,If you do not know the , , used in the , block, you can use the ""three dots"" syntax (,) inside the , block, which will handle any type of exception:",,,
C++ ,Booleans,"C++ Booleans,Boolean Values",Example,"Very often, in programming, you will need a data type that can only have one of two values, like:,For this, C++ has a , data type, which can take the values , 
(1) or , (0).,A boolean variable is declared with the , keyword and can only take the values , or ,:,From the example above, you can read that a , value returns ,, and , returns ,.,However, it is more common to return boolean values from boolean expressions
