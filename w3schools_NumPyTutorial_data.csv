,:,A dimension in arrays is one level of array depth (nested arrays).,0-D arrays, 
or Scalars, are the elements in an array. Each value in an array is a 0-D array.,An array that has 0-D arrays as its elements is called uni-dimensional or 1-D array.,These are the most common and basic arrays.,An array that has 1-D arrays as its elements is called a 2-D array.,These are often used to represent matrix or 2nd order tensors.,An array that has 2-D arrays (matrices) as its elements is called 3-D array.,These are often used to represent a 3rd order tensor.,NumPy Arrays provides the , attribute that returns an integer that tells us how many dimensions the array have.,An array can have any number of dimensions.,When the array is created, you can define the number of dimensions by using 
the , argument.,In this array the innermost dimension (5th dim) has 4 elements,
the 4th dim has 1 element that is the vector,
the 3rd dim has 1 element that is the matrix with the vector,
the 2nd dim has 1 element that is 3D array and 1st dim has 1 element that is a 4D array.",,,
NumPy ,Getting Started,"Installation of NumPy,Import NumPy,NumPy as np,Checking NumPy Version","Example,Example,Example","If you have , and , already installed on a system, then installation of 
NumPy is very easy.,Install it using this command:,If this command fails, then use a python distribution that already has NumPy installed like, Anaconda, Spyder etc.,Once NumPy is installed, import it in your applications by adding the
, keyword:,Now NumPy is imported and ready to use.,NumPy is usually imported under the , 
alias.,Create an alias with the , keyword while importing:,Now the NumPy package can be referred to as , instead of ,.,The version string is stored under ,

NumPy ,Introduction,"What is NumPy?,Why Use NumPy?,Why is NumPy Faster Than Lists?,Which Language is NumPy written in?,Where is the NumPy Codebase?",,"NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.,It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.,NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project 
and you can use it freely.,NumPy stands for Numerical Python.,In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.,NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than 
traditional Python lists.,The array object in NumPy is called ,, 
it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with 
, very easy.,Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources 
are very important.,NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.,This behavior is called locality of reference in computer science.,This is the main reason why NumPy is faster than lists. Also it is optimized to work with latest CPU architectures.,NumPy is a Python library and is written partially in Python, but most of the parts that require fast computation are written in C or C++.,The source code for NumPy is located at this github repository
