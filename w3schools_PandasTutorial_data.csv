Pandas ,Tutorial,"Learning by Reading,Learning by Quiz Test,Learning by Exercises,Learning by Examples",Example,"We have created 14 tutorial pages for you to learn more about Pandas.,Starting with a basic introduction and ends up with cleaning and plotting data:,Test your Pandas skills with a quiz test.,In our ""Try it Yourself"" editor, you can use the Pandas module, and modify the code to see the result.",,,
Pandas - ,Cleaning Data of Wrong Format,"Data of Wrong Format,Convert Into a Correct Format,Removing Rows","Example,Example","Cells with data of wrong format can make it difficult, or even impossible, to analyze data.,To fix it, you have two options: remove the rows, or convert all cells in the 
columns into the same format.,In our Data Frame, we have two cells with the wrong format. Check out row 22 
and 26, the 'Date' column should be a string that represents a date:,Let's try to convert all cells in the 'Date' column into dates.,Pandas has a , method for this:,As you can see from the result, the date in row 26 was fixed,
but the empty date in row 22 got a NaT (Not a Time) value, in other words an 
empty value. One way to deal with empty values is simply removing the entire row.,The result from the converting in the example above gave us a NaT value, which can be handled as a NULL value, and we can remove the row by using the 
, method.",,,
Pandas - ,Cleaning Empty Cells,"Empty Cells,Remove Rows,Replace Empty Values,Replace Using Mean, Median, or Mode","Example,Example,Example,Example,Example,Example,Example","Empty cells can potentially give you a wrong result when you analyze data.,One way to deal with empty cells is to remove rows that contain empty cells.,This is usually OK, since data sets can be very big, and removing a few rows 
will not have a big impact on the result.,In our cleaning examples we will be using a CSV file called 'dirtydata.csv'.,. or ,If you want to change the original DataFrame, use the
, argument:,Another way of dealing with empty cells is to insert a , value instead.,This way you do not have to delete entire rows just because of some empty 
cells.,The , method allows us to replace empty 
cells with a value:,The example above replaces all empty cells in the whole Data Frame.,To only replace empty values for one column,
specify the , for the DataFrame:,A common way to replace empty cells, is to calculate the mean, median or mode value of the 
column.,Pandas uses the , 
, and , methods to 
calculate the respective values for a specified column:",,,
Pandas - ,Cleaning Data,"Data Cleaning,Our Data Set",,"Data cleaning means fixing bad data in your data set.,Bad data could be: ,In this tutorial you will learn how to deal with all of them.,In the next chapters we will use this data set:,The data set contains some empty cells (""Date"" in row 22, and ""Calories"" in row 18 and 28).,The data set contains wrong format (""Date"" in row 26).,The data set contains wrong data (""Duration"" in row 7).,The data set contains duplicates (row 11 and 12).","Empty cells,Data in wrong format,Wrong data,Duplicates",,

Pandas - ,Removing Duplicates,"Discovering Duplicates,Removing Duplicates","Example,Example","Duplicate rows are rows 
that have been registered more than one time.,By taking a look at our test data set, we can assume that row 11 and 12 are duplicates.,To discover duplicates, we can use the , method.,The , method returns a Boolean values for each row:,To remove duplicates, use the , method.",,,
Pandas - ,Plotting,"Plotting,Scatter Plot,Histogram","Example,Example,Result,Example,Result,Example,Result","Pandas uses the , method to create 
diagrams.,We can use Pyplot, a submodule of the Matplotlib library to visualize the 
diagram on the screen.,Read more about Matplotlib in our ,.,The examples in this page uses a CSV file called: 'data.csv'., or ,Specify that you want a scatter plot with the , argument:,A scatter plot needs an x- and a y-axis.,In the example below we will use ""Duration"" for the x-axis
and ""Calories"" for the y-axis.,Include the x and y arguments like this:,Let's create another scatterplot, where there is a bad relationship between the columns, like ""Duration"" and ""Maxpulse"", with the correlation ,:,Use the , argument 
to specify that you want a histogram:,A histogram needs only one column.,A histogram shows us the frequency of each interval, e.g. how many workouts lasted between 50 and 60 minutes?,In the example below we will use the ""Duration"" column to create the histogram:",,,
Pandas - ,DataFrame Reference,,,"All properties and methods of the DataFrame object, with explanations and 
examples:",,,
Pandas - ,Data Correlations,Finding Relationships,"Example,Result","A great aspect of the Pandas module is the , method.,The , method calculates the relationship between each column in your data set.,The examples in this page uses a CSV file called: 'data.csv'.,. or ,The Result of the , method is a table with a lot of numbers that represents
how well the relationship is between two columns.,The number varies from -1 to 1.,1 means that there is a 1 to 1 relationship (a perfect correlation),
and for this data set, each time a value went up in the first column, the other one went up as well.,0.9 is also a good relationship, and if you increase one value, the other will probably increase as well.,-0.9 would be just as good relationship as 0.9, but if you increase one value, the other will probably go down.,0.2 means NOT a good relationship, meaning that if one value goes up does not mean that the other will.,We can see that ""Duration"" and ""Duration"" got the number ,, which makes sense,
each column always has a perfect relationship with itself.,""Duration"" and ""Calories"" got a , correlation, 
which is a very good correlation, and we can predict that the longer you work 
out, the more calories you burn, and the other way around: if you burned a lot 
of calories, you probably had a long work out.,""Duration"" and ""Maxpulse"" got a , correlation, 
which is a very bad correlation, meaning that we can not predict the max pulse 
by just looking at the duration of the work out, and vice versa.",,,
Pandas - ,Analyzing DataFrames,"Viewing the Data,Info About the Data,Result Explained,Null Values","Example,Example,Example,Example","One of the most used method for getting a quick overview of the DataFrame, is the , method.,The , method returns the headers and 
a specified number of rows, starting from the top.,In our examples we will be using a CSV file called 'data.csv'.,Download ,, or open
, in your browser.,There is also a , method for viewing the 
, rows of the DataFrame.,The , method returns the headers and 
a specified number of rows, starting from the bottom.,The DataFrames object has a method called ,, that 
gives you more information about 
the data set.,The result tells us there are 169 rows and 4 columns:,And the name of each column, with the data type:,The , method also tells us how many Non-Null values there are present in each column,
and in our data set it seems like there are 164 of 169 Non-Null values in the ""Calories"" column.,Which means that there are 5 rows with no value at all, in the ""Calories"" column, for whatever reason.,Empty values, or Null values, can be bad when analyzing data,
and you should consider removing rows with empty values.
This is a step towards what is called ,,
and you will learn more about that in the next chapters.",,,
Pandas ,Read JSON,"Read JSON,Dictionary as JSON","Example,Example","Big data sets are often stored, or extracted as JSON.,JSON is plain text, but has the format of an object, and is well known in the world of programming, including Pandas.,In our examples we will be using a JSON file called 'data.json'.,.,If your JSON code is not in a file, but in a Python Dictionary, you can load it into a DataFrame 
directly:",,,
Pandas ,Read CSV,"Read CSV Files,max_rows","Example,Example,Example,Example","A simple way to store big data sets is to use CSV files (comma separated 
files).,CSV files contains plain text and is a well know format that can be read by everyone including Pandas.,In our examples we will be using a CSV file called 'data.csv'.,. or ,If you have a large DataFrame with many rows, Pandas will only return the first 5 rows, and the last 5 rows:,The number of rows returned is defined in Pandas option settings.,You can check your system's maximum rows with the , statement.,In my system the number is 60, which means that if the DataFrame contains more than 60 rows,
the , statement will return only the headers and the first and last 5 rows.,You can change the maximum rows number with the same statement.",,,
Pandas ,DataFrames,"What is a DataFrame?,Locate Row,Named Indexes,Locate Named Indexes,Load Files Into a DataFrame","Example,Example,Example,Example,Example,Example","A Pandas DataFrame is a 2 dimensional data structure, like a 2 dimensional 
array, or a table with rows and columns.,As you can see from the result above, the DataFrame is like a table with rows and columns.,Pandas use the , attribute to return  
one or more specified row(s),With the , argument, you can name your own indexes.,
Use the named index in the , attribute to return the specified row(s).
,If your data sets are stored in a file, Pandas can load them into a DataFrame.",,,
Pandas ,Series,"What is a Series?,Labels,Create Labels,Key/Value Objects as Series,DataFrames","Example,Example,Example,Example,Example,Example,Example","A Pandas Series is like a column in a table.,It is a one-dimensional array holding data of any type.,If nothing else is specified, the values are labeled with their index number. First value 
has index 0, second value has index 1 etc.,This label can be used to access a specified value.,With the , argument, you can name your own labels.,When you have created labels, you can access an item by referring to the label.,You can also use a key/value object, like a dictionary, when creating a Series.,To select only some of the items in the dictionary, use the , 
argument and specify only the items you want to include in the Series.,Data sets in Pandas are usually multi-dimensional tables, called DataFrames.,Series is like a column, a DataFrame is the whole table.,You will learn about ,.",,,
Pandas ,Getting Started,"Installation of Pandas,Import Pandas,Pandas as pd,Checking Pandas Version","Example,Example,Example","If you have , and , already installed on a system, then installation of Pandas is very easy.,Install it using this command:,If this command fails, then use a python distribution that already has Pandas installed like, Anaconda, Spyder etc.,Once Pandas is installed, import it in your applications by adding the
, keyword:,Now Pandas is imported and ready to use.,Pandas is usually imported under the , 
alias.,Create an alias with the , keyword while importing:,Now the Pandas package can be referred to as , instead of 
,.,The version string is stored under , 
attribute.",,,
Pandas ,Introduction,"What is Pandas?,Why Use Pandas?,What Can Pandas Do?,Where is the Pandas Codebase?",,"Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets.,It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.,The name ""Pandas"" has a reference to both ""Panel Data"", and ""Python Data 
Analysis"" and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008.,Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on 
statistical theories.,Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant.,Relevant data is very important in data science.,Pandas gives you answers about the data. Like:,Pandas are also able to delete rows that are not relevant, or contains wrong 
values, like empty or NULL values. This is called , the data.,The source code for Pandas is located at this github repository
","Is there a correlation between two or more columns?,What is average value?,Max value?,Min value?",,
Pandas - ,Fixing Wrong Data,"Wrong Data,Replacing Values,Removing Rows","Example,Example,Example","""Wrong data"" does not have to be ""empty cells"" or ""wrong format"", it can  
just be wrong, like if someone registered ""199"" instead of ""1.99"".,Sometimes you can spot wrong data by looking at the data set, because you have an expectation of what 
it should be.,If you take a look at our data set, you can see that in row 7, the duration is 450, but for all the other rows the duration is between 30 and 60.,It doesn't have to be wrong, but taking in consideration that this is the data set of someone's workout 
sessions,
we conclude with the fact that this person did not work out in 450 minutes.,How can we fix wrong values, like the one for ""Duration"" in row 7?,One way to fix wrong values is to replace them with something else.,In our example, it is most likely a typo, and the value should be ""45"" instead of ""450"", and 
we 
could just insert ""45"" in row 7:,For small data sets you might be able to replace the wrong data one by one, 
but not for big data sets.,To replace wrong data for larger data sets you can create some rules, e.g. 
set some boundaries for legal values, and replace any values that are outside of the 
boundaries.,Another way of handling wrong data is to remove the rows that contains wrong data.,This way you do not have to find out what to replace them with, and there is 
a good chance you do not need them to do your analyses.",,,
