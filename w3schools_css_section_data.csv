checks the device width, instead of the browser width. Then the image will not change when you resize the browser window:
,The HTML , element gives web 
developers more flexibility in specifying image resources.,The most common use of the , 
element will be for images used in responsive designs. Instead of having one 
image that is scaled up or down based on the viewport width, multiple images can 
be designed to more nicely fill the browser viewport.,The , element works similar to the , and

certain condition is true.,Earlier in this tutorial we made a web page with rows and columns, and it 
was responsive, but it did not look good on a small screen.,Media queries can help with that. We can add a breakpoint where 
certain parts of the design will behave differently on each side of the 
breakpoint.,Use a media query to add a breakpoint at 768px:,Mobile First means designing for mobile before designing for desktop or any 
other device (This will make the page display faster on smaller devices).,This means that we must make some changes in our CSS.,Instead of changing styles when the width gets , than 
768px, we should change the design when the width gets , than 
768px. This will make our design Mobile First:,You can add as many breakpoints as you like.,We will also insert a breakpoint between tablets and mobile phones.,We do this by adding one more media query (at 600px), and a set of new classes for devices larger than 600px 
(but smaller than 768px):,It might seem odd that we have two sets of identical classes, but it gives us the 
opportunity ,, to decide what will happen with the columns at each 
breakpoint:,There are tons of screens and devices with different heights and widths, so it is hard to create an exact breakpoint for each device. To keep things simple you could target 
five groups:,Media queries can also be used to change layout of a page depending on the 
orientation of the browser.,You can have a set of CSS properties that will only 
apply when the browser window is wider than its height, a so called ""Landscape""

This makes sure that the padding and border are included in the total width and height of 
the elements.,Add the following code in your CSS:,Read more about the , property in our , chapter.,The following example shows a simple responsive web page, with two columns:,The example above is fine if the web page only contains two columns.,However, we want to use a responsive grid-view with 12 columns, to have more 
control over the web page.,First we must calculate the percentage for one column: 100% / 12 columns = 
8.33%.,Then we 
make one class for each of the 12 columns, , and a number 
defining how many columns the section should span:, All these columns should be floating to the left, and have a padding of 15px:,Each row should be wrapped in a ,. The number of columns 
inside a row should always add up to 12:,The columns inside a row are all floating to the left, and are therefore 
taken out of the flow of the page, and other elements will be placed as if the columns do not exist. To prevent this, we will 
add a style that clears the flow:,We also want to add some styles and colors to make it look better:",,"

Responsive Web Design - ,The Viewport,"What is The Viewport?,Setting The Viewport,Size Content to The Viewport",,"The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page.,The viewport varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.,Before tablets and mobile phones, web pages were designed only for computer screens, and it was common for
web pages to have a static design and a fixed size.,Then, when we started surfing the internet using tablets and mobile phones, fixed 
size web pages were too large to fit the viewport.
To fix this, browsers on those devices scaled down the entire web page to fit the screen.,This was not perfect!! But a quick fix.,HTML5 introduced a method to let web designers take control over the viewport, through the 
, tag.,You should include the following , viewport element in all your web pages:,This gives the browser instructions on how 
to control the page's dimensions and scaling.,The , part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).,The , part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.,Here is an example of a web page , the viewport meta tag, and the same web page , the viewport meta tag:,Users are used to scroll websites vertically on both desktop and mobile 
devices - but not horizontally!,So, if the user is forced to scroll horizontally, or zoom out, to see the 
whole web page it results in a poor user experience.,Some additional rules to follow:,For example, if 
an image is displayed at a width wider than the viewport it can cause the 
viewport to scroll horizontally. Remember to adjust this content to fit within 
the width of the viewport., - Since screen dimensions and width in CSS pixels vary 
widely between devices, content should not rely on a particular viewport width 
to render well., - Setting large absolute CSS widths for page elements 
will cause the element to be too wide for the viewport on a smaller device. 
Instead, consider using relative width values, such as width: 100%. Also, be 
careful of using large absolute positioning values. It may cause the element to 
fall outside the viewport on small devices.",,,

CSS properties from the .button-basic class, through the , directive. In 
addition, they have their own colors defined:,After compilation, the CSS will look like this:,By using the , directive, you do not need to

Sass ,@import and Partials,"Sass Importing Files,Sass Partials","Example,Example,Example,Example","Sass keeps the CSS code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). One way to 
write DRY code is to keep related code in separate files.,You can create small files with CSS snippets to include in other Sass files. Examples 
of such files can be: reset file, variables, colors, fonts, font-sizes, etc. ,Just like CSS, Sass also supports the , 
directive.,The , directive allows you to include 
the content of one file in another.,The CSS , directive has a major drawback 
due to performance issues; it creates an extra HTTP request 
each time you call it. However, the Sass , 
directive 
includes the file in the CSS; so no extra HTTP call is required at runtime!, You do not need to specify a 
file extension, Sass automatically assumes that you mean a .sass or .scss file. 
You can also import CSS files. The , 
directive imports the file and any variables or mixins defined in the imported 
file can then be used in the main file.,You can import as many files as you need in the main file:,Let's look at an example: Let's assume we have a reset file called ""reset.scss"", that looks like this:,and now we want to import the ""reset.scss"" file into another file called ""standard.scss"".,Here is how we do it: It is normal to add the , 
directive at the top of a file; this way its content will have a global scope:,So, when the ""standard.css"" file is transpiled, the CSS will look like this:,By default, Sass transpiles all the .scss files directly. However, when you want to 
import a file, you do not need the file to be transpiled directly.,Sass has a mechanism for this: If you start the filename with an underscore, Sass will not transpile it. Files named this way are called partials in 
Sass.,So, a partial Sass file is named with a leading underscore:,The following example shows a partial Sass file named ""_colors.scss"". 
(This file will not be transpiled directly to ""colors.css""):,Now, if you import the partial file, omit the underscore. Sass understands 
that it should 
import the file ""_colors.scss"":",,,

you use features that do not exist in CSS, like variables, nested rules, mixins,

inheritance, built-in functions, and other stuff.,Let's say we have a website with three main colors:,So, how many times do you need to type those HEX values? A LOT of times. And 
what about variations of the same colors? ,Instead of typing the above values a lot of times, you can use Sass and write this:,So, when using Sass, and the primary color changes, you only need to change 
it in one place.,A browser does not understand Sass code. Therefore, you will need a Sass 
pre-processor to convert Sass code into standard CSS.,This process is called transpiling. So, you need to give a transpiler 
(some kind of program) some Sass code and then get some CSS code back.,Sass files has the "".scss"" file extension. ,Sass supports standard CSS comments ,,

,, and , selectors are nested inside the , selector.,While in CSS, the rules are defined one by one (not nested):,Because you can nest properties in Sass, it is cleaner and easier to read 
than standard CSS.,Many CSS properties have the same prefix, like font-family, font-size and 
font-weight or text-align, text-transform and text-overflow.,With Sass you can write them as nested properties:,The Sass transpiler will convert the above to normal CSS:",,,

After the variables are declared, you can use the variables wherever you want:,So, when the Sass file is transpiled, it takes the variables (myFont, myColor, 
etc.) and outputs normal CSS with the variable values placed in the CSS, like 
this:,Sass variables are only available at the level of nesting where they are defined.,Look at the following example:,Will the color of the text inside a , tag be red or green? It will be red!,The other definition, $myColor: green; is inside the

in design on different screen sizes.,A common use of media queries, is to create a flexible layout. In this example, we create a layout that varies between four, two and full-width columns, depending on different screen sizes:,Another common use of media queries, is to hide elements on different screen sizes:,You can also use media queries to change the font size of an element on

expressions, which resolve to either true or false.,The result of the query is 
true if the specified media type matches the type of device the document is 
being displayed on and all expressions in the media query are true. When a media query is true, the corresponding style sheet or style rules are 
applied, following the normal cascading rules.,Unless you use the not or only operators, the media type is optional and the

multiple lines: ,From the HTML tutorial, you learned that you can add comments to your HTML source by using the 
, syntax.,In the following example, we use a combination of HTML and CSS comments:",,"
  <!DOCTYPE html>,<html>,<head>,<style>,p {,  color: red; /* Set 
  text color to red */,} ,</style>,</head>,<body>,<h2>My 
  Heading</h2>,<!-- These paragraphs will be red -->,<p>Hello 
  World!</p>,<p>This paragraph is styled with CSS.</p>,<p>CSS comments are 
  not shown in the output.</p>,</body>,</html>,

,How To Add CSS,"Three Ways to Insert CSS,External CSS,Internal CSS,Inline CSS,Multiple Style Sheets,Cascading Order","Example,""mystyle.css"",Example,Example,Example,Example","When a browser reads a style sheet, it will format the HTML document according to 
the information in the style sheet.,There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:,With an
external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing 
just one file!,Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside 
the <link> element, inside the head section.,An external style sheet can be written in any text editor, and must be saved with a .css extension.,The external .css file should not contain any HTML tags.,Here is how the ""mystyle.css"" file looks:,An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.,The internal style is defined inside the <style> element, inside the head 
section.,An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.,To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The
style attribute can contain any CSS property.,If some properties have been defined for the same selector (element) in different style sheets,
the value from the last read style sheet will be used. ,What style will be used when there is more than one style specified for an HTML element?,All the styles in a page will ""cascade"" into a new ""virtual"" style
sheet by the following rules, where number one has the highest priority:,So, an inline style has the highest priority, and will override external and 
internal styles and browser defaults.","External CSS,Internal CSS,Inline CSS","

CSS ,Selectors,"CSS Selectors,The CSS element Selector,The CSS id Selector,The CSS class Selector,The CSS Universal Selector,The CSS Grouping Selector,All CSS Simple Selectors","Example,Example,Example,Example,Example,Example,Example","A CSS selector selects the HTML element(s) you 
want to style.,CSS selectors are used to ""find"" (or select) the HTML elements you 
want to style.,We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:,This page will explain the most basic CSS selectors.,The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.,The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.,The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is 
used to 
select one unique element!,To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by 
the id of the element.,The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.,To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the 
class name.,You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class.,HTML elements 
can also refer to more than one class.,The universal selector (*) selects all HTML 
elements on the page.,The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style 
definitions.,Look at the following CSS code (the h1, h2, and p elements have the same 
style definitions):,It will be better to group the selectors, to minimize the code.,To group selectors, separate each selector with a comma.","Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class), (select  
  elements based on a specific relationship between them), (select elements based on a certain state), (select 
  and style a part of an element), (select elements based on 
  an attribute or attribute value)","

CSS ,Syntax,CSS Syntax,Example,"A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.,The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.,The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by 
semicolons.,Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.,Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration 
blocks are surrounded by curly braces."," is a selector in CSS (it points to the HTML element you want to style:

CSS ,Introduction,"What is CSS?,CSS Demo - One HTML Page - Multiple Styles!,Why Use CSS?,CSS Solved a Big Problem,CSS Saves a Lot of Work!",CSS Example,"CSS is the language we use to style a Web page.,Here we will show one HTML page displayed with four different stylesheets. 
Click on the ""Stylesheet 1"", ""Stylesheet 2"", ""Stylesheet 3"", ""Stylesheet 4"" 
links below to see the different styles:,CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout 
and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.,HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!,HTML was 
created to describe the content of a web page, like:,<h1>This is a heading</h1>,<p>This is a paragraph.</p>,When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 
specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large 
websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single  
page, became a long and expensive process.,To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.,CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!,The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files.,With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!","CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets,CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,  
  paper, or in other media,CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of 
  multiple web pages all at once,External stylesheets are stored in CSS files",,
