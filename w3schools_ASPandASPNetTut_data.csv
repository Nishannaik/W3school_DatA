any code in the file, and returns the result to the browser.,ASP (aka Classic ASP) was introduced in 1998 
as Microsoft's first server side scripting language.,Classic ASP pages have the file extension , and are normally written in VBScript.,ASP.NET was released in 2002 as a successor to Classic ASP.,ASP.NET pages have the extension , and are normally written in C# (C sharp).,ASP.NET 4.6 is the latest official version of ASP.NET.,ASP.NET 5 was expected to be an important redesign of ASP.NET.,However, the development of ASP.NET 5 was stopped in favor of

How to insert a variable value in a text.,Do you remember algebra from school? x=5, y=6, z=x+y,Do you remember that a letter (like x) could be used to hold a value (like 5), and that you could use the information above to calculate the value of z to be 11?,These letters are called ,, and variables can be used to hold values (x=5) or expressions (z=x+y).,As with algebra, VBScript variables are used to hold values or expressions.,A variable can have a short name, like x, or a more descriptive name, like carname.,Rules for VBScript variable names:,In VBScript, all variables are of type ,, that can store different types of data.,Creating variables in VBScript is most often referred to as ""declaring"" variables.,You can declare VBScript variables with the Dim, Public or the Private statement. Like this:,Now you have created two variables. The name of the variables are ""x"" and ""carname"".,You can also declare variables by using its name in a script. Like this:,Now you have also created a variable. The name of the variable is ""carname"". However, this method is not a good practice, because you can misspell the variable name later
in your script, and that can cause strange results when your script is running., If you misspell for example the ""carname"" variable to ""carnime"", 
the script will automatically create a new variable called ""carnime"".  To prevent your script from doing this, you can use the Option Explicit statement.
This statement forces you to declare all your variables with the dim, public or 
private statement., Put the Option Explicit statement on the top of your script. Like this:,You assign a value to a variable like this:,The variable name is on the left side of the expression and the value you want to
assign to the variable is on the right. Now the variable ""carname"" has
the value of ""Volvo"", and the variable ""x"" has the value of ""10"".,An array variable is used to store multiple values in a single variable.,
In the following example, an array containing
3 elements is declared:
,The number shown in the parentheses is 2. We start at zero so this array contains 3 elements. This is a fixed-size array.
You assign data to each of the elements of the array like this:,Similarly, the data can be retrieved from any element using the index of the particular array element you want.
Like this:,You can have up to 60 dimensions in an array. Multiple dimensions are declared by separating
the numbers in the parentheses with commas. Here we have a two-dimensional array consisting of 5 rows and 7 columns:
,Assign data to a two-dimensional array:,A variable declared outside a procedure can be accessed and changed by any script in the ASP file. ,A variable declared inside a procedure is created and destroyed every time the procedure is executed. No scripts outside the procedure can access or change the variable. ,To declare variables accessible to more than one ASP file, declare them as session variables or application variables.,Session variables are used to store information about ONE single user, and are available to all pages in one application. Typically information stored in session variables are name, id, and preferences.,Application variables are also available to all pages in one application. Application variables are used to store information about ALL users in one specific application.","Must begin with a letter ,Cannot contain a period (.),Cannot exceed 255 characters",,

syntax that's easier to learn if you're a beginner, and makes you more 
productive if you're an expert. ,Razor web pages can be described as HTML pages with two kinds of content: 
HTML content and Razor code. ,When the server reads the page, it runs the Razor code first, before it sends 
the HTML page to the browser. The code that is executed on the server can 
perform tasks that cannot be done in the browser, for example accessing a server 
database. Server code can create dynamic HTML content on the fly, before it is 
sent to the browser. Seen from the browser, the HTML generated by server code is 
no different than static HTML content.,ASP.NET web pages with Razor syntax have the special file extension cshtml

ASP ,Quick Reference,"Basic Syntax,Forms and User Input,ASP Cookies,Including Files,Global.asa,The Session Object,Application Object,The Response Object,Request Object,Server Object",,"ASP Quick Reference from W3Schools. Print it, and fold it in your pocket.,ASP scripts are surrounded by <% and %>.  To write some 
output to a browser:,<html>,
<body>,
<%
response.write(""Hello World!"")
%>,
</body>,
</html>,The default language in ASP is VBScript. To use another scripting language, 
insert a language specification at the top of the ASP page:,<%@ language=""javascript"" %>,
<html>,
<body>,<%,
....,
%>,Request.QueryString is used to collect values in a form with method=""get"". 
Information sent from a form with the GET method is visible to everyone (it will 
be displayed in the browser's address bar) and has limits on the amount of 
information to send.,Request.Form is used to collect values in a form with method=""post"". 
Information sent from a form with the POST method is invisible to others and has 
no limits on the amount of information to send.,A cookie is often used to identify a user. A cookie is a small file that the 
server embeds on the user's computer. Each time the same computer requests for a 
page with a browser, it will send the cookie too.,The Response.Cookies command is used to create cookies:,<%,
Response.Cookies(""firstname"")=""Alex"",
Response.Cookies(""firstname"").Expires=""May 10,2002"",
%>, The Response.Cookies command must appear BEFORE the <html> tag!,The ""Request.Cookies"" command is used to retrieve a cookie value:,<%,
fname=Request.Cookies(""firstname""),
response.write(""Firstname="" & fname),
%>, You can insert the content of one ASP file into another ASP file before the 
server executes it, with the #include directive. The #include directive is used 
to create functions, headers, footers, or elements that will be reused on 
multiple pages,Syntax:,<!--#include virtual=""somefile.inc""-->,
or,
<!--#include file =""somefile.inc""-->,Use the virtual keyword to indicate a path beginning with a virtual 
directory. If a file named ""header.inc"" resides in a virtual directory named 
/html, the following line would insert the contents of ""header.inc"":,<!-- #include virtual =""/html/header.inc"" -->,Use the file keyword to indicate a relative path. A relative path begins with 
the directory that contains the including file. If you have a file in the html 
directory, and the file ""header.inc"" resides in html\headers, the following line 
would insert ""header.inc"" in your file:,<!-- #include file =""headers\header.inc"" -->,Use the file keyword with the syntax (..\) to include a file from a 
higher-level directory.,The Global.asa file is an optional file that can contain declarations of 
objects, variables, and methods that can be accessed by every page in an ASP 
application., , The Global.asa file must be stored in the
root directory of the ASP application, and each application can only have one
Global.asa file.,The Global.asa file can contain only the following:,In Global.asa you can tell the application and session objects what to do 
when the application/session starts and what to do when the application/session 
ends. The code for this is placed in event handlers. , We do not use
<% and %>, to
insert scripts in the Global.asa file, we have to put the subroutines inside the
HTML <script> tag:,<script language=""vbscript"" runat=""server"">,
 sub Application_OnStart,
   ' some code,

 sub Application_OnEnd,
   ' some code,
 end sub,
 sub Session_OnStart,
   ' some code,
 end sub,
 sub Session_OnEnd,
   ' some code,

 </script>,It is also possible to create objects with session or application scope in 
 Global.asa by using the <object> tag. , The <object> tag should be 
 outside the <script> tag!,Syntax:,<object runat=""server"" scope=""scope"" id=""id"",
 {progid=""progID""|classid=""classID""}>,
 .......,
 </object>,A TypeLibrary is a container for the contents of a DLL file corresponding to 
 a COM object. By including a call to the TypeLibrary in the Global.asa file, 
 the constants of the COM object can be accessed, and errors can be better 
 reported by the ASP code. If your Web application relies on COM objects that 
 have declared data types in type libraries, you can declare the type libraries 
 in Global.asa.,Syntax:, <!--METADATA TYPE=""TypeLib"",
 file=""filename"",
 uuid=""typelibraryuuid"",
 version=""versionnumber"",
 lcid=""localeid"",
 -->,The Session object is used to store information about, or change settings for 
a user session. Variables stored in the Session object hold information about 
one single user, and are available to all pages in one application.,A group of ASP files that work together to perform some 
 purpose is called an application. The Application object in ASP is used to tie 
 these files together. All users share one Application object. The Application object
should hold information that will be used by many pages in the application (like
database connection information).,The Response Object is used to send output to the user from the server.,When a browser asks for a page from a server, it is called a request. The
Request Object is used to get information from the user.,The Server Object is used to access properties and methods on the server.","Application events ,Session events ,<object> declarations  ,TypeLibrary declarations ,the #include directive,

amounts of data with the server behind the scenes. This means that it is 
possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.,Classic web pages, (which do not use AJAX) must reload the entire page if the 
content should change.,Examples of applications using AJAX: Google Maps, Gmail, Youtube, and 
Facebook tabs.,AJAX is based on internet standards, and uses a combination of:,AJAX was made popular in 2005 by Google, with Google Suggest., 
is using AJAX to create a very dynamic web interface: 
When you start typing in Google's search box, a JavaScript sends the letters off 
to a server and the server returns a list of suggestions.,In our ASP tutorial, we will demonstrate how AJAX can update parts of a web 
page, without reloading the whole page. The server script will be written in ASP.,If you want to learn more about AJAX, visit our ,.,The following example will demonstrate how a web page can communicate with a 
web server while a user type characters in an input field:,In the example above, when a user types a character in the input field, a function 
called ""showHint()"" is executed.,The function is triggered by the onkeyup event.,Here is the HTML code:,Code explanation:,First, check if the input field is empty (str.length == 0). If it is, clear the 
content of the txtHint placeholder and exit the function.,However, if the input field is not empty, do the following:,The ASP file checks an array of names, and returns the corresponding name(s) to the 
browser:,AJAX can be used for interactive communication with a database.,The following example will demonstrate how a web page can fetch 
information from a database with AJAX:,When a user selects a customer in the dropdown list above, a function called ""showCustomer()"" is executed. The 
function is triggered by the ""onchange"" event:,Source code explanation:,If no customer is selected (str.length==0), the function clears the 
content of the txtHint placeholder and exits the function.,If a customer is selected, the showCustomer() function executes the following:,The page on the server called by the JavaScript above is an ASP file called ""getcustomer.asp"".,The source code in ""getcustomer.asp"" runs a query against a database, and returns the result in an HTML 
table:","XMLHttpRequest object (to exchange data asynchronously with a server),JavaScript/DOM (to display/interact with the information),CSS (to style the data),XML (often used as the format for transferring data),Create an XMLHttpRequest object,Create the function to be executed when the server response is ready,Send the request off to an ASP file (gethint.asp) on the server,Notice that q parameter is added gethint.asp?q=""+str,The str variable holds the content of the input field,Create an XMLHttpRequest object,Create the function to be executed when the server response is ready,Send the request off to a file on the server,Notice that a parameter (q) is added to the URL (with the content of the

can be accessed by every page in an ASP application.,All valid browser scripts (JavaScript, VBScript, JScript, PerlScript, etc.) can be used within Global.asa.,The Global.asa file can contain only the following:, The Global.asa file must be stored in the root directory of the
ASP application, and each application can only have one Global.asa file.,In  Global.asa you can tell the application and session objects what to do when the application/session starts and what to do when the
application/session ends. The code for this is placed in event handlers. The Global.asa file can contain four types of events:, - This event occurs EVERY time a NEW user requests his or her first page in the ASP application., - This event occurs EVERY time a user ends a session. A user-session ends after a page has not been requested by the user for a 
specified time (by default this is 20 minutes)., - This event occurs after the LAST user has ended the session. Typically, this event occurs when a Web server stops.
This procedure is used to clean up settings after the Application stops, like delete records or write information to text files.,A Global.asa file could look something like this:, Because we cannot use the ASP script delimiters (<% and %>) to insert scripts in the Global.asa file, we put subroutines inside an HTML 
<script> element.,It is possible to create objects with session or application scope in Global.asa by using the <object> tag., The <object> tag should be outside the <script> tag!,The first example creates an object of session scope named ""MyAd"" by using the ProgID parameter:,The second example creates an object of application scope named ""MyConnection"" by using the ClassID parameter:,The objects declared in the Global.asa file can be used by any script in the application:,A TypeLibrary is a container for the contents of a DLL file corresponding to a COM object. By including a call to the TypeLibrary in the Global.asa file,
the constants of the COM object can be accessed, and errors can be better reported by the ASP code. If your Web application relies on COM objects that have
declared data types in type libraries, you can declare the type libraries in Global.asa.,The server can return one of the following error messages:, METADATA tags can appear anywhere in the Global.asa file (both inside and outside <script> tags). However, it is recommended that
METADATA tags appear near the top of the Global.asa file.,Restrictions on what you can include in the Global.asa file:,Global.asa is often used to initialize variables. , The example below shows how to detect the exact time a visitor first arrives on a Web site. The time is stored in a Session variable named 
""started"", and the value of the ""started"" variable can be accessed from any ASP page in the application:,Global.asa can also be used to control page access.,The example below shows how to redirect every new visitor to another page, in this case to a
page called ""newpage.asp"":,And you can include functions in the Global.asa file.,In the example below the Application_OnStart subroutine occurs when the Web server starts. Then
the Application_OnStart subroutine calls another subroutine named ""getcustomers"".
The ""getcustomers"" subroutine opens a database and retrieves a record set from
the ""customers"" table. The record set is assigned to an array, where it
can be accessed from any ASP page without querying the database:,In this example we will create a Global.asa file that counts the number of current visitors.,The Global.asa file:,To display the number of current visitors in an ASP file:","Application events,Session events,<object> declarations,TypeLibrary declarations,the #include directive, You cannot display text written in the Global.asa file.

    objects. In the Session_OnStart subroutine you can use any built-in object,The Application_OnStart sets the Application variable ""visitors"" to 0 when the server starts,The Session_OnStart subroutine adds one to the variable ""visitors"" every time a new visitor arrives,The Session_OnEnd subroutine subtracts one from ""visitors"" each time this subroutine is triggered",,

ASP ,Including Files,"The #include Directive,How to Use the #include Directive,Syntax for Including Files,Tips and Notes",,"You can insert the content of one ASP file into another ASP file before the
server executes it, with the #include directive.,The #include directive is used to create functions, headers, footers, or 
elements that will be reused on multiple pages.,Here is a file called ""mypage.asp"":,Here is the ""wisdom.inc"" file:,Here is the ""time.inc"" file:,If you look at the source code in a browser, it will look something like this:,To include a file in an ASP page, place the #include directive inside comment tags:,Use the virtual keyword to indicate a path beginning with a virtual directory.,If a file named ""header.inc"" resides in a virtual directory named /html, the following line would insert the contents of ""header.inc"":,Use the file keyword to indicate a relative path. A relative path begins with the directory that contains the including file.,If you have a file in the html directory, and the file ""header.inc"" resides in html\headers, the following line would insert ""header.inc"" in your file:,Note that the path to the included file (headers\header.inc) is relative to the including file. 
If the file containing this #include statement is not in the html directory, the statement will not work.,In the sections above we have used the file extension "".inc"" for included files. Notice that if a user tries to browse an INC file directly,
its content will be displayed. If your included file contains confidential information or information you do not want any users to see, it is better to use an 
ASP extension. The source code in an ASP file will not be visible after the interpretation. An included file can also include other files,
and one ASP file can include the same file more than once., Included files are processed and inserted before the scripts are executed. The following script will NOT work because ASP executes the 
#include directive before it assigns a value to the variable:,You cannot open or close a script delimiter in an INC file. The following script will NOT work:,But this script will work:",,,

use the , property.,The example below sets a timeout interval of 5 minutes:,Use the , method to end a session immediately:, The main problem with sessions is WHEN they should end. We do 
not know if the user's last request was the final one or not. So we do not know 
how long we should keep the session ""alive"". Waiting too long for an idle 
session uses up resources on the server, but if the session is deleted too soon 
the user has to start all over again because the server has deleted all the 
information. Finding the right timeout interval can be difficult!,The most important thing about the Session object is that you can store variables in it.,The example below will set the Session variable , to ""Donald Duck"" and the Session variable , to ""50"":,When the value is stored in a session variable it can be reached from ANY page in the ASP application:,The line above returns: ""Welcome Donald Duck"".,You can also store user preferences in the Session object, and then access

embeds on the user's computer. Each time the same computer requests a page with a browser, it will send the cookie
too. With ASP, you can both create and retrieve cookie values.,The ""Response.Cookies"" command is used to create cookies., The Response.Cookies command must appear BEFORE the <html> tag.,In the example below, we will create a cookie named ""firstname"" and assign the value ""Alex"" to it:,It is also possible to assign properties to a cookie, like setting a date when the cookie should expire:,The ""Request.Cookies"" command is used to retrieve a cookie value.,In the example below, we retrieve the value of the cookie named ""firstname"" and display it on a page:, Firstname=Alex,If a cookie contains a collection of multiple values, we say that the cookie has Keys.,In the example below, we will create a cookie collection named ""user"".

tutorial.,Below is a short description of some useful Razor helpers:,The WebGrid helper simplifies the way to display data:,The ""Chart Helper"" can display chart images of different types with 
many formatting options and labels.,
,
,
,
The Chart helper can display data from arrays , from databases, or from files.
,The WebMail helper provides functions for sending email messages using SMTP 
(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).,The WebImage helper provides functionality to manage images in a web page.,Keywords: flip, rotate, resize, watermark.,With Razor you can take advantage of built-in or third party helpers to 
simplify the use of email, databases, multimedia, and social networks as well as 
many other issues like navigation and web security.

ASP.NET Web Pages ,- Databases,"What We Will Do,Displaying Data from Database,Adding a Customers Page,Example Explained,ASP.NET Database Object Reference",Products.cshtml,"This chapter is about working with databases.,In this chapter we will:,With Web Pages, you can easily display data from a database.,You can connect to an existing database, or create a new database from scratch.,In this example we will connect to an existing SQL Server Compact database.,In the ""DemoWebPages"" folder, create a new CSHTML file named ""Products.cshtml"".,Replace the code in the file with the code from the example below:,The Database.Open(,) method will connect to a database in two 
steps:,First, it searches the application's App_Data folder for a database that 
matches the , parameter without the file-name extension.,If no file is found, it looks for a ""connection string"" in the 
application's Web.config file.,(A connection string contains information about how to connect to a database. It can include a file path, or the name of an SQL database, with full user name and password),This two-step search makes it possible to test the application with a local 
database, and run the application on a web host using a connection string. ",Create a web page to list data from a database,,

file name to the name of the Excel file).",How to read and display data from a text file,,
ASP.NET Web Pages ,- HTML Forms,"Creating an HTML Input Page,Razor Example - Displaying Images,Example explained","Razor Example,Razor Example","A form is a section of an HTML document where you put input 
controls (text boxes, check boxes, radio buttons, and pull-down lists).,Suppose you have 3 images in your image folder, and you want to display images dynamically 
by the users choice.,This is easily done by a little Razor code. ,If you have an image called ""Photo1.jpg"" in your images folder on your web 
site, you can display the image using an HTML 
<img> element like this:,The example below shows how to display a selected 
picture which the user selects 
from a drop-down list:  ,The server creates a variable called ,.,The HTML page has a , (a <select> element) named ,. 
It lets the user select a friendly name (like ,), and passes a file 
name (like ,) when the page is submitted to the web server.,The Razor code reads the value of Choice by ,. If it has a value the 
code constructs a path to the image images/Photo1.jpg, and stores it in the 
variable ,.,In the HTML page there is an <img>
element to display the image. The src attribute is set to the value of the imagePath 
variable when the page displays.,The <img> element is in an if block to 
prevent trying to display an image with no name (like the first time the page is 
displayed).",,,
ASP.NET Web Pages ,- Global Pages,"Before Web Startup: _AppStart,Before Every Page: _PageStart,How Does it Work?",,"This chapter is about the global pages AppStart and PageStart.,
Most server side code are written inside individual web pages. For example, if a 
web page contains an input form, the web page typically contains server code for 
reading the data.,
However, by creating a page named _AppStart in the root of your site, you can 
have startup code executed before the site starts. If this page 
exists, ASP.NET runs it the first time any page in the site is requested.,
Typical use for _AppStart is startup code and initialization of global values 
like counters and global names.,
, _AppStart should have the same file extension as your 
web pages, like: _AppStart.cshtml.  ,
,_AppStart has an underscore prefix. Because of this, 
the files cannot be browsed directly.,
Just like _AppStart runs before your site starts, you can write code that 
runs before any page in each folder.,
For each folder in your web, you can add a file named _PageStart.,
Typical use for _PageStart is setting the layout page for all pages in a 
folder, or checking that a user is logged in before running a page.,
The following diagram shows how it works:,
,
When a request comes in, ASP.NET checks whether _AppStart exists. 
If so, and this is the first request to the site, _AppStart runs.,
Then ASP.NET checks whether _PageStart exists. If so, _PageStart runs, before the requested page.,
If you include a call to RunPage() inside _PageStart you specify where you want 
the requested page to run. If not, the _PageStart runs before the 
requested page.",,,
ASP.NET Web Pages ,- Objects,"The Page Object,Some Page Object Methods,
,Some Page Object Properties,
,The Page Property (of the Page Object)","Home.cshtml,Layout.cshtml"," Web Pages is much often about Objects.,You have already seen some Page Object methods in use:,In the previous chapter you saw two Page Object properties being used (IsPost, and 
Request):,The Page property of the Page Object, provides property-like access to data shared between pages and layout 
    pages.,You can use (add) your own properties to the Page property:,The pages property is very helpful. For instance, it makes it possible to set 
the page title in content files, and use it in the layout file:","Page.Title,Page.Version,Page.anythingyoulike",,
ASP.NET Web Pages ,- Folders,"Logical Folder Structure,Physical Folder Structure,Virtual and Physical Names,URLs and Paths,The ~ Operator,The 
Server.MapPath Method,The Href Method",,"This chapter is about folders and folder paths.,In this chapter you will learn:,
Below is a typical folder structure for an ASP.NET web pages web site: ,
The physical  
structure for the ""Images"" folder at the website above might look like this on a computer:,
C:\Johnny\Documents\MyWebSites\Demo\Images , ,
From the example above:,
The virtual name of a web picture might be ""Images/pic31.jpg"".,
But the physical name is ""C:\Johnny\Documents\MyWebSites\Demo\Images\pic31.jpg"",URLs are used to access files from the web:
, ,The URL corresponds 
to a physical file on a server: C:\MyWebSites\w3schools\html\html5_intro.asp ,A virtual 
path is shorthand to represent physical paths. If you use virtual paths, you can move your 
pages to a different domain 
(or server) without having to update the paths. ,The root on a disk drive is written like C:\, but the root on a web site is  / 
(forward slash).,The virtual path of a 
web folder is (almost) never the same as the physical folder.,In your code you will, reference both the physical path and the virtual path, depending on what 
you are coding. ,ASP.NET has 3 tools for working with folder paths: the ~ operator, the Server.MapPath method, 
and the Href method.,To specify the virtual root in programming code, use the ~ operator.,If you use the ~ operator, instead of a path, you can move your website to a different folder or 
location without changing any code:,The Server.MapPath method converts a virtual path (/default.cshtml) to a 
physical path that the server can understand (C:\Johnny\MyWebSited\Demo\default.cshtml).,You will use this method when you need to open data 
files located on the server (data files can only be accessed with a full 
physical path):,You will learn more about reading from (and writing to) data files on the server in 
the next chapter of this tutorial.,The Href method converts a path used in the code to a path that the browser 
can understand (the browser cannot understand the ~ operator).,You use the Href method to create paths to resources like image files, and CSS files.,You will often use this method in HTML 
<a>, <img>, and <link> elements:,The Href method is a method of the WebPage Object.","About Logical and Physical folder structures,About Virtual and Physical names,About web URLs and Paths,The ""Account"" folder contains logon and security files,The ""App_Data"" folder contains databases and data files,The ""Images"" folder contains images,The ""Scripts"" folder contains browser scripts,The ""Shared"" folder contains common files (like layout and style files)",,
ASP.NET Web Pages ,- Page Layout,"A Consistent Look,Content Blocks,Using a Layout Page,D.R.Y. - Don't Repeat Yourself,Preventing Files from Being Browsed,Hiding Sensitive Information","Example,Layout Page:,Any Web Page:,_AppStart.cshtml","With Web Pages it is easy to create a web site with a 
consistent layout.,On the Internet you will discover many web sites with a consistent look and 
feel:,With Web Pages this can be done very efficiently. You can have reusable 
blocks of content (content blocks), like headers and footers, in separate files.,You can 
also define a consistent layout for all your pages, using a layout template 
(layout file).,Many websites have content that is displayed on every 
page (like headers and footers).,With Web Pages you can use the , method to import content from separate 
files.,Content block (from another file) can be imported anywhere in a web page, and 
can contain text, markup, and code, just like any regular web page. ,Using common headers and footers as an example, this saves you a lot of work. You don't have to write the 
same content in every page, and when you change the header or footer files, the 
content is 
updated in all your pages.,This is how it looks in code:,In the previous section, you saw that including the same content in many 
web pages is easy.,Another approach to creating a consistent look is to use a layout page. A layout page 
contains the structure, but not the content, of a web page. When a web page 
(content page) is linked to a layout page, it will be displayed 
according to the layout page (template).,The layout page is just like a normal web page, except from a call to the
, method where the content page will be 
included.,Each content page must start with a ,.,This is how it looks in code:,With two ASP.NET tools, Content Blocks and Layout Pages, you can give your 
web applications a consistent look.,These tools also save you a lot of work, since you don't have to repeat the 
same information on all pages. Centralizing markup, style, and code makes web 
applications much more manageable and easier to maintain.,With ASP.NET, files with a name that starts with an underscore cannot be 
browsed from the web.,If you want to prevent your content blocks or layout files from being viewed 
by your users, rename the files to:,_header.cshtml,_footer.cshtml,_Layout.cshtml,With ASP.NET, the common way to hide sensitive information (database passwords, 
email passwords, etc.) is to keep the information in a separate file named 
""_AppStart"".","Every page have the same header,Every page have the same footer,Every page have the same style and layout",,
