print to screen that ""a and b are equal"".,You can use as many , statements as you want in R.,The , keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions:,In this example, , is greater than ,,

You can add as many
arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma.,The following example has a function with one argument (fname). When the function is called, we
pass along a first name, which is used inside the function to print the full name:,By default, a function must be called with the correct number of arguments. Meaning that if your
function expects 2 arguments, you have to call the function with 2 arguments, not more, and not less:,If you try to call the function with 1 or 3 arguments, you will get an error:,The following example shows how to use a default parameter value.,If we call the function without an argument, it uses the default value:,To let a function return a result, use the , function:,The output of the code above will be:,There are two ways to create a nested function:,The function tells x to add y.,The first input Nested_function(2,2) is ""x"" of the main function.,The second input Nested_function(3,3) is ""y"" of the main function.,The output is therefore (2+2) + (3+3) = ,.,You cannot directly call the function because the Inner_func has been defined (nested) inside the
Outer_func.,We need to call Outer_func first in order to call Inner_func as a second step.
,We need to create a new variable called output and give it a value, which is 3 here.,We then print the output with the desired value of ""y"", which in this case is 5.,The output is therefore , (3 + 5).,R also accepts function recursion, which means a defined function can call itself.,Recursion is a common mathematical and programming concept. It means that a function calls itself.
This has the benefit of meaning that you can loop through data to reach a result.,The developer should be very careful with recursion as it can be quite easy to slip into writing a
function which never terminates, or one that uses excess amounts of memory or processor power.
However, when written correctly, recursion can be a very efficient and mathematically-elegant
approach to programming.,In this example, , is a function that we have defined to call itself (""recurse""). We use the
, variable as the data, which decrements (,) every time we recurse. The recursion ends when the
condition is not greater than 0 (i.e. when it is 0).,To a new developer it can take some time to work out how exactly this works, best way to find out is
by testing and modifying it.","Call a function within another function.,Write a function within a function.",,

loops (which you will learn more about in a later chapter):,You can also concatenate, or join, two or more elements, by using the , function.,To combine both text and a variable, R uses comma (,):,You can also use , to add a variable to another variable:,For numbers, the , character works as a mathematical operator:,If you try to combine a string (text) and a number, R will give you an error:,R allows you to assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:","A variable name must start with a letter and can be a combination of 
letters, digits, period(.),and underscore(_). If it starts with period(.), it 
cannot be followed by a digit.,A variable name cannot start with a number or underscore (_),Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables),Reserved words cannot be used as variables (TRUE, FALSE, NULL, if...)",,
R ,Comments,"Comments,Multiline Comments","Example,Example,Example,Example","Comments can be used to explain R code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to 
prevent execution when testing alternative code.,Comments starts with a ,. When executing the R-code, R will ignore anything 
that starts with ,.,This example uses a comment before a line of code:,This example uses a comment at the end of a line of code:,Comments does not have to be text to explain the code, it can also be used to prevent R from
executing the code:,Unlike other programming languages, such as ,, there are no syntax in R for multiline comments. However, we can just insert a , for each line 
to create multiline comments:",,,
R ,Introduction,"What is R,Why Use R?,Get Started",,"R is a popular programming language used for statistical computing and graphical presentation.,Its most common use is to analyze and visualize data.,This tutorial will teach you the basics of R.,It is not necessary to have any prior programming experience.","It is a great resource for data analysis, data visualization, data science and machine learning,It provides many statistical techniques (such as statistical tests, classification, clustering and data reduction),It is easy to draw graphs in R, like pie charts, histograms, box plot, scatter plot, etc++,It works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux),It is open-source and free,It has a large community support,It has many packages (libraries of functions) that can be used to solve different problems",,
R ,Syntax,Syntax,"Example,Example,Example","To output text in R, use single or double quotes:,To output numbers, just type the number (without quotes):,To do simple calculations, add numbers together:,Congratulations! You have now written your first R code.",,,
R ,Get Started,"How to Install R,Learning R at W3Schools",Example,"To install R, go to , and download the latest version of R for Windows, Mac or Linux.,When you have downloaded and installed R, you can run R on your computer.,The screenshot below shows how it may look like when you run R on a Windows 
PC:,If you type ,, and press enter, you will see that R outputs ,.,When learning R at W3Schools.com, you can use our ""Try it Yourself"" tool, which shows both the code and the result 
in your browser. This will make it easier for you to test and understand every part as we move forward:",,,
