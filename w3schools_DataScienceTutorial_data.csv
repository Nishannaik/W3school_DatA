  when x = 0,The horizontal axis is generally called the x-axis. Here, it 
represents Average_Pulse.,The vertical axis is generally called 
the y-axis. Here, it represents Calorie_Burnage.,Calorie_Burnage is a function of Average_Pulse, because 
Calorie_Burnage is assumed to be dependent on Average_Pulse.,In other words, we 
use Average_Pulse to predict Calorie_Burnage. ,The blue (diagonal) line 
represents the structure of the mathematical function that predicts calorie 
burnage.",,

Data Science ,Introduction,"What is Data Science?,Where is Data Science Needed?,How Does a Data Scientist Work?,Where to Start?",,"Data Science is a combination of multiple disciplines that uses statistics, 
data analysis, and machine learning to analyze data and to extract knowledge and insights from it.,Data Science is about data gathering, analysis and decision-making.,Data Science is about finding patterns in data, through analysis, and make 
future predictions.,By using Data Science, companies are able to make:,Data Science is used in many industries 
in the world today, e.g. banking, consultancy, healthcare, and manufacturing.,Examples of where Data Science is needed:,Data Science can be applied in nearly every part of a business where data is available. Examples are:,A Data Scientist requires expertise in several 
backgrounds: ,A Data Scientist must find patterns within the data. Before he/she can find 
the patterns, he/she must organize the data in a standard format.,Here is how a Data Scientist works:,In this tutorial, we will start by presenting what data is and how data can be analyzed.,You will learn how to use statistics and mathematical functions to make 
predictions.","Better decisions (should we choose A or B),Predictive analysis (what will happen next?),Pattern discoveries (find pattern, or maybe hidden information in the 
  data),For route planning: To discover the best routes to ship,To foresee delays for flight/ship/train etc. (through predictive
