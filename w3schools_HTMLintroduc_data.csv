This attribute is important if the image 
for some reason cannot be displayed.,Also, always define the , and , of images. This reduces flickering, because the browser can reserve space for 
the image before loading.,HTML allows spaces around equal signs. But space-less is easier to read and 
groups entities better together.,When using an HTML editor, it is NOT convenient to scroll right and left to read the HTML code.,Try to avoid too long code lines.,Do not add blank lines, spaces, or indentations without a reason.,For readability, add blank lines to separate large or logical code blocks.,For readability, add two spaces of indentation. Do not use the tab key.,The , element is required in HTML.,The contents of a page title is very important for search engine optimization 
(SEO)! The page title is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order 
when listing pages in search results.,The , element:,So, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible: ,An HTML page will validate without the , and 
, tags:,However, we strongly recommend to always add the , and 
, tags!,Omitting , can produce errors in older browsers.,Omitting , and , 
can also crash DOM and XML software.,The HTML <head> tag can also 
be omitted.,Browsers will add all elements before ,, to a default , 
element.,However, we recommend using the , tag.,In HTML, it is optional to close empty elements.,If you expect XML/XHTML software to access your page, keep the 
closing slash (/), because it is required in XML and XHTML.,You should always include the , attribute 
inside the , tag, to declare the 
language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.,To ensure proper interpretation and correct search engine indexing, both the language and 
the character encoding , should be defined as early as possible in an HTML document:,The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies with the device 
- it will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.,You should include the following , element in all your web pages:,This gives the browser instructions on how 
to control the page's dimensions and scaling.,The , part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).,The , part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.,Here is an example of a web page , the viewport meta tag, and the same web page , the viewport meta tag:,Short comments should be written on one line, like this:,Comments that spans more than one line, should be written like this:,Long comments are easier to observe if they are indented with two spaces.,Use simple syntax for linking to style sheets (the , attribute is not necessary):,Short CSS rules can be written compressed, like this:,Long CSS rules should be written over multiple lines:,Use simple syntax for loading external scripts (the , attribute is not necessary):,Using ""untidy"" HTML code can result in JavaScript errors.,These two JavaScript statements will produce different results:,.,Some web servers (Apache, Unix) are case sensitive about file names: ""london.jpg"" cannot be accessed as 
""London.jpg"". ,Other web servers (Microsoft, IIS) are not case sensitive: ""london.jpg"" can be accessed as 
""London.jpg"".,If you use a mix of uppercase and lowercase, you have to be aware of this.,If you move from a case-insensitive to a case-sensitive server, even small 
errors will break your web!,To avoid these problems, always use lowercase file names!,HTML files should have a , extension (, is allowed).,CSS files should have a , extension.,JavaScript files should have a , extension.,There is no difference between the .htm and .html file extensions!,Both will be 
treated as HTML by any web browser and web server.,When a URL does not specify a filename at the end (like ""https://www.w3schools.com/""), 
the server just adds a default filename, such as ""index.html"", 
""index.htm"", ""default.html"", or ""default.htm"".,If your server is configured only with ""index.html"" as the default filename, your 
file must be named ""index.html"", and not ""default.html"".,However, servers can be configured with more than one default filename; 
usually you can set up as many default filenames as you want.","Mixing uppercase and lowercase names looks bad,Developers normally use lowercase names,Lowercase looks cleaner,Lowercase is easier to write,Mixing uppercase and lowercase names looks bad,Developers normally use lowercase names,Lowercase look cleaner,Lowercase are easier to write,Developers normally quote attribute values,Quoted values are easier to read,You MUST use quotes if the value contains spaces,defines a title in the browser toolbar,provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites,displays a title for the page in search-engine results,Place the opening bracket on the same line as the selector,Use one space before the opening bracket,Use two spaces of indentation,Use semicolon after each property-value pair, including the last,Only use quotes around values if the value contains spaces,Place the closing bracket on a new line, without leading spaces","

a website, to make it look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones):,
,
,To create a responsive website, add the following , 
tag to all your web pages:,This will set the viewport of your page, which will give the browser instructions on how 
to control the page's dimensions and scaling.,Here is an example of a web page , the viewport meta tag, and the same web page , the viewport meta tag:,Responsive images are images that scale nicely to fit any browser size.,If the CSS , property is set to 100%, the image will be responsive and scale 
up and down:,Notice that in the example above, the image can be scaled up to be larger than its original size.
A better solution, in many cases, will be to use the , property instead.,If the , property is set to 100%, the image will scale down if it has to, but never scale up to be larger than its original size:,The HTML , element allows you to define different images for 
different browser window sizes.,Resize the browser window to see how the image below change depending on the width:,The text size can be set with a ""vw"" unit, which means the ""viewport width"".,That way the text size will follow the size of the browser window:,In addition to resize text and images, it is also common to use media queries 
in responsive web pages.,With media queries you can define completely different styles for different browser 
sizes.,Example: resize the browser window to see that the three div elements below will display 
horizontally on large screens and stacked vertically on small screens:,A responsive web page should look good on large desktop screens and on small mobile phones.,
,
,All popular CSS Frameworks offer responsive design.,They are free, and easy to use.,
W3.CSS is a modern CSS framework with support for desktop, tablet, and mobile 
design by default.,
W3.CSS is smaller and faster than similar CSS frameworks.,
W3.CSS is designed to be a high quality alternative to Bootstrap.,
W3.CSS is designed to be independent of jQuery or any other JavaScript library.,To learn more about W3.CSS, read our ,.,Another popular CSS framework is Bootstrap. Bootstrap uses HTML, CSS and jQuery to make responsive web pages.,To learn more about Bootstrap, go to our ,.",,"

HTTP ,Request Methods,"What is HTTP?,HTTP Methods,The GET Method,The POST Method,The PUT Method,The HEAD Method,The DELETE Method,The OPTIONS Method,Compare GET vs. POST",,"The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable 
communications between clients and servers.,HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server.,Example: A client (browser) sends an HTTP request to the server; then the server 
returns a response to the client. The response contains status information about 
the request and may also contain the requested content.,The two most common HTTP methods are: GET and POST.,Note that the query string (name/value pairs) is sent in the URL of 
a GET request:,The data sent to the server with POST is stored in the request body of the 
HTTP request:,The difference between POST and PUT is that PUT requests are idempotent. That 
is, calling the same PUT request multiple times will always produce the same 
result. In contrast, calling a POST request repeatedly have side effects of 
creating the same resource multiple times.,In other words, if GET /users returns a list of users, then HEAD /users will 
make the same request but will not return the list of users.,HEAD requests are useful for checking what a GET request will return before 
actually making a GET request - like before downloading a large file or response 
body.,The following table compares the two HTTP methods: GET and POST.","GET requests can be cached,GET requests remain in the browser history,GET requests can be bookmarked,GET requests should never be used when dealing with sensitive data,GET requests have length restrictions,GET requests are only used to request data (not modify),POST requests are never cached,POST requests do not remain in the browser history,POST requests cannot be bookmarked,POST requests have no restrictions on data length",,

"You Have Learned HTML, ",Now What?,"HTML Summary,Now You Know HTML, What's Next?,Learn CSS,Learn JavaScript,Publishing Your Website,Using an Internet Service Provider,Hosting Your Own Website",,"This tutorial has taught you how to use HTML to create your own web site.,HTML is the universal markup language for the Web. HTML lets you format text, add graphics, 
create links, input forms, frames and tables, etc., and save it all in a text file that any
browser can read and display.,For more information on HTML, please take a look at our , and our ,.,You can also test your HTML skills with , and ,.,CSS lets you style your HTML pages.,CSS gives you total control of the layout, without messing up the document content.,To learn more about CSS, please visit our ,.,JavaScript makes your website more dynamic. A dynamic website can react to events and allow user interaction.,JavaScript is the most popular scripting language on the internet and it works with all major browsers.,If you want to learn more about JavaScript, please visit our ,.,To make your website available to the world, you must publish it.,For this, you have two options:,An Internet service provider (ISP) is a company that provides services for 
accessing and using the Internet.,Internet services typically provided by ISPs include Internet access, 
Internet transit, domain name registration, web hosting, Usenet service, and 
colocation.,Using an Internet Service Provider (ISP) is the most common option. ,Hosting your own website, on your own server, is also an option.","Use an Internet Service Provider,Host your own website, - ISPs have very fast connections to the internet., - ISPs have powerful web servers that can be shared by several clients.
You can also expect an effective load balancing and necessary backup servers
 , - ISPs are specialists on web hosting. Expect more than 99% up time, the latest software patches, and the best virus protection, - The ISP should offer 24-hours support. Toll-free phone could also be vital, - The ISP must run a daily backup routine, - Check the ISP's traffic volume restrictions (do not end up paying a fortune for unexpected
high traffic), - Check the ISP's bandwidth and content restrictions (Is it possible to publish pictures, video, or sound?), - Make sure the ISP supports the e-mail capabilities you need, - Make sure the ISP supports the database access you need, - To run a ""real"" web site, you must buy powerful 
server hardware (a low cost PC will not do the job). You will also 
need a permanent (24/7) high-speed connection, - Server-licenses are often higher than client-licenses.
 Server-licenses also might have limits on number of users, - Don't expect low labor expenses. You have to install your own hardware and software.
You also have to deal with bugs and viruses, and keep your server constantly running",,

of other scripts, without affecting the performance of the page. You can continue to do whatever you want: 
clicking, selecting things, etc., while the web worker runs in the background.,The numbers in the table specify the first browser version that fully support Web Workers.,The example below creates a simple web worker that count numbers in the background:,Before creating a web worker, check whether the user's browser supports it:,Now, let's create our web worker in an external JavaScript.,Here, we create a script that counts. The script is stored in the ""demo_workers.js"" file:,The important part of the code above is the , method - which is used to post a message back to the HTML page., Normally web workers are not used for such simple scripts, but for more CPU intensive tasks.,Now that we have the web worker file, we need to call it from an HTML page.,The following lines checks if the worker already exists, if not - it creates a new web worker object and runs the code in 
""demo_workers.js"":,Then we can send and receive messages from the web worker.,Add an ""onmessage"" event listener to the web worker.,When the web worker posts a message, the code within the event listener is executed. The data 
from the web worker is stored in event.data.,When a web worker object is created, it will continue to listen for messages (even after the external script is finished) until it is terminated.,To terminate a web worker, and free browser/computer resources, use the 
, method:,If you set the worker variable to undefined, after it has been terminated, 
you can reuse the code:,We have already seen the Worker code in the .js file. Below is the code for the HTML page:,Since web workers are in external files, they do not have access to the following JavaScript objects:","The window object,The document object,The parent object","

It is when you ""grab"" an object and drag it to a different location.,The numbers in the table specify the first browser version that fully supports Drag and Drop.,The example below is a simple drag and drop example:,It might seem complicated, but lets go through all the different parts of a drag and drop event.,First of all: To make an element draggable, set the , attribute to true:,Then, specify what should happen when the element is dragged.,In the example above, the , attribute calls a function, drag(event), 
that specifies what data to be dragged.,The , method sets the data type and the value of the 
dragged data:,In this case, the data type is ""text"" and the value is the id of the draggable element (""drag1"").,The , event specifies where the dragged data can be dropped.,By default, data/elements cannot be dropped in other elements. To allow a drop, 
we must prevent the default handling of the element.,This is done by calling the , method for the ondragover event:,When the dragged data is dropped, a drop event occurs.,In the example above, the ondrop attribute calls a function, drop(event):,Code explained:","Call preventDefault() to prevent the browser default handling of the data (default is open as link on drop),Get the dragged data with the dataTransfer.getData() method.

available. With server-sent events, the updates come automatically.,Examples: Facebook/Twitter updates, stock price updates, news feeds, sport results, etc.,The numbers in the table specify the first browser version that fully support server-sent events.,The EventSource object is used to receive server-sent event notifications:,Example explained:,In the tryit example above there were some extra lines of code to check browser support for server-sent events:,For the example above to work, you need a server capable of sending data updates (like PHP or ASP).,The server-side event stream syntax is simple. Set the ""Content-Type"" header to 
""text/event-stream"". Now you can start sending event streams.,Code in PHP (demo_sse.php):,Code in ASP (VB) (demo_sse.asp):,Code explained:,In the examples above we used the onmessage event to get messages.

HTML ,Web Storage API,"What is HTML Web Storage?,Browser Support,HTML Web Storage Objects,The localStorage Object,The sessionStorage Object","Example,Example,Example","HTML web storage; better than cookies.,With web storage, web applications can store data locally within the user's browser.,Before HTML5, application data had to be stored in cookies, included in 
every server request. Web storage is more secure, and large amounts of data 
can be stored locally, without affecting website performance.,Unlike cookies, 
the storage limit is far larger (at least 5MB) and information is never 
transferred to the server.,Web storage is per origin (per domain and protocol). All pages, from one 
origin, can store and access the same data.,The numbers in the table specify the first browser version that fully supports 
Web Storage.,HTML web storage provides two objects for storing data on the client:,Before using web storage, check browser support for localStorage and sessionStorage:,The localStorage object stores the data with no expiration date. The data 
will not be deleted when the browser is closed, and will be available the next day, week, or year.,Example explained:,The example above could also be written like this:,The syntax for removing the ""lastname"" localStorage item is as follows:, Name/value pairs are always stored as strings. 
Remember to convert them to another format when needed!,The following example counts the number of times a user has clicked a button. 
In this code the value string is converted to a number to be able to increase the counter:,The , object is equal to the localStorage object, , 
that it stores the data for only one session. The data is deleted when the user closes the

which character set to use.,ASCII was the first character encoding standard. ASCII defined 128 different characters that could be used on the internet: numbers (0-9), English letters (A-Z), and some special 
characters like ! $ + - ( ) @ < > .,ISO-8859-1 was the default character set for HTML 4. This character set 
supported 256 different character codes. HTML 4 also supported UTF-8.,ANSI (Windows-1252) was the original Windows character set. ANSI is identical 
to ISO-8859-1, except that ANSI has 32 extra characters.,The HTML5 specification encourages web developers to use the UTF-8 character 
set, which covers almost all of the 
characters and symbols in the world!,To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know the character set used in the page. ,This is specified in the , tag:,The following table displays the differences between the character sets described above:,ASCII uses the values from 0 to 31 (and 127) for control characters.,ASCII uses the values from 32 to 126 for letters, digits, and symbols.,ASCII does not use the values from 128 to 255.,ANSI is identical to ASCII for the values from 0 to 127.,ANSI has a proprietary set of characters for the values from 128 to 159.,ANSI is identical to UTF-8 for the values from 160 to 255.,ISO-8859-1 is identical to ASCII for the values from 0 to 127.,ISO-8859-1 does not use the values from 128 to 159.,ISO-8859-1 is identical to UTF-8 for the values from 160 to 255.,UTF-8 is identical to ASCII for the values from 0 to 127.,UTF-8 does not use the values from 128 to 159.  ,UTF-8 is identical to both ANSI and 8859-1 for the values from 160 to 255.,UTF-8 continues from the value 256 with more than 10 000 different

separated by a non-breaking space will stick together (not break into a new 
line). This 
is handy when breaking the words might be disruptive.,Examples:,Another common use of the non-breaking space is to prevent browsers from truncating spaces in HTML pages.,If you write 10 spaces in your text, the browser will remove 9 of them. To add real spaces to your text, 
you can use the , character entity.,A diacritical mark is a ""glyph"" added to a letter.,Some diacritical marks, like grave (  ̀) and acute (  ́) are called accents. ,Diacritical marks can appear both above and below a letter, inside a letter,

between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background 
images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices 
and screen sizes, and much more!,CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:,The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS 
files. However, in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, because this is easier to 
demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.,An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.,An inline CSS uses the , attribute of an HTML element.,The following example sets the text color of the , element to blue, 
and the text color of the , element to red:,An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.,An internal CSS is defined in the , section of an HTML page, 
within a , element.,The following example sets the text color of ALL the , elements 
(on that page) to blue, and the text color of ALL the , elements to 
red. In addition, the page will be displayed with a ""powderblue"" background

HTML code, and must be saved with a .css extension.,Here is what the ""styles.css"" file looks like:,Here, we will demonstrate some commonly used CSS properties. You will learn 
more about them later.,The CSS , property defines the text color to be used.,The CSS , property defines the font to be used.,The CSS , property defines the text size to be used.,The CSS , property defines a border 
around an HTML element., You can define a border for nearly all HTML elements.,The CSS , property defines a padding

space for the referenced image.,The , tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not 
have a closing tag.,The , tag has two required 
attributes:,The required , attribute specifies the path (URL) to the image., When a web page loads, it is the browser, at that 
moment, that gets the image from a web server and inserts it into the page. 
Therefore, make sure that the image actually stays in the same spot in relation 
to the web page, otherwise your visitors will get a broken link icon. The broken 
link icon and the , text are shown if the browser cannot find the image.,The required , attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for 
some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src 
attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).,The value of the , attribute should describe the image:,If a browser cannot find an image, it will display the value of the ,
