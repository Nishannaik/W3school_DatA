The second argument is optional.,Let's use a timer as an example.,But wait!! I keeps counting even though it should only count once!, runs on every render. That means that when the count changes, a render happens, which then triggers another effect.,This is not what we want. There are several ways to control when side effects run.,We should always include the second parameter which accepts an array.
We can optionally pass dependencies to , in this array.,So, to fix this issue, let's only run this effect on the initial render.,If there are multiple dependencies, they should be included in the , dependency array.,Some effects require cleanup to reduce memory leaks.,Timeouts, subscriptions, event listeners, and other effects that are no longer needed should be disposed.,We do this by including a return function at the end of the , Hook.",,,
"React , Hook",,"Import ,Initialize ,Read State,Update State,What Can State Hold,Updating Objects and Arrays in State","Example:,Example:,Example:,Example:,Example:,Example:,Example:","The React , Hook allows us to track state in a function component.,State generally refers to data or properites that need to be tracking in an application.,To use the , Hook, we first need to , it into our component.,Notice that we are destructuring , from , as it is a named export.,We initialize our state by calling , in our function component., accepts an initial state and returns two values:,Notice that again, we are destructuring the returned values from ,.,The first value, ,, is our current state.,The second value, ,, is the fuction that is used to update our state.,Lastly, we set the initial state to an empty string: ,We can now include our state anywhere in our component.,To update our state, we use our state updater function.,The , Hook can be used to keep track of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, and any combination of these!,We could create multiple state Hooks to track individual values.,Or, we can just use one state and include an object instead!,When state is updated, the entire state gets overwritten.,What if we only want to update the color of our car?,If we only called ,, this would remove the brand, model, and year from our state.,We can use the JavaScript spread operator to help us.,Because we need the current value of state, we pass a function into our , function.

"React , Hook",,Solution,"Example:,Example:","The React , Hook returns a memoized callback function.,This allows us to isolate resource intensive functions so that they will not automatically run on every render.,The , Hook only runs when one of its dependencies update.,This can improve performance.,One reason to use , is to prevent a component from re-rendering unless its props have changed.,In this example, you might think that the , component will not re-render unless the , change:,Try running this and click the count increment button.,You will notice that the , component re-renders even when the , do not change.,Why does this not work? We are using ,, so the , component should not re-render since neither the , state nor the , function are changing when the count is incremented.,This is because of something called ""referential equality"".,Every time a component re-renders, its functions get recreated. Because of this, the , function has actually changed.,To fix this, we can use the , hook to prevent the function from being recreated unless necessary.,Use the , Hook to prevent the , component from re-rendering needlessly:,Now the , component will only re-render when the , prop changes.",,,
"React , Hook",,Syntax,Example:,"The , Hook is similar to the , Hook.,It allows for custom state logic.,If you find yourself keeping track of multiple pieces of state that rely on complex logic, , may be useful.,The useReducer Hook accepts two arguments.,The , function contains your custom state logic and the ,can be a simple value but generally will contain an object.,The , Hook returns the current ,and a ,method.,Here is an example of , in a counter app:,This is just the logic to keep track of the todo complete status.,All of the logic to add, delete, and complete a todo could be contained within a single
, Hook by adding more actions.",,,
React useContext Hook,,"React Context,The Problem,The Solution,Full Example","Example:,Example:","React Context is a way to manage state globally.,It can be used together with the , Hook to share state between
deeply nested components more easily than with , alone.,State should be held by the highest parent component in the stack that requires access to the state.,To illustrate, we have many nested components. The component at the top and bottom of the stack need access to the state.,To do this without Context, we will need to pass the state as ""props"" through each nested component. This is called ""prop drilling"".,Even though components 2-4 did not need the state, they had to pass the state along so that it could reach component 5.,The solution is to create context.,To create context, you must Import , and initialize 
it:,Next we'll use the Context Provider to wrap the tree of components that need the state Context.,Wrap child components in the Context Provider and supply the state value.,Now, all components in this tree will have access to the user Context.,In order to use the Context in a child component, we need to access it using the , Hook.,First, include the , in the import 
statement:,Then you can access the user Context in all components:",,,
"React , Hook",,"Does Not Cause Re-renders,Accessing DOM Elements,Tracking State Changes","Example:,Example:,Example:","The , Hook allows you to persist values between renders.,It can be used to store a mutable value that does not cause a re-render when updated.,It can be used to access a DOM element directly.,If we tried to count how many times our application renders using the , Hook, we would be caught in an infinite loop since this Hook itself causes a re-render.,To avoid this, we can use the , Hook., only returns one item. It returns an Object called ,.,When we initialize , we set the initial value: ,.,Run this on your computer and try typing in the input to see the application render count increase.,In general, we want to let React handle all DOM manipulation.,But there are some instances where , can be used without causing issues.,In React, we can add a , attribute to an element to access it directly in the DOM.,The , Hook can also be used to keep track of previous state values.,This is because we are able to persist , values between renders.,This time we use a combination of ,, ,, and , to keep track of the previous state.,In the ,, we are updating the , current value each time the , is updated by entering text into the input field.",,,

React Forms,,"Adding Forms in React,Handling Forms,Submitting Forms,Multiple Input Fields,Textarea,Select","Example:,Example:,Example:,Example:,Example:,HTML:,Example:","Just like in HTML, React uses forms to allow users to interact with the web page.,You add a form with React like any other element:,This will work as normal, the form will submit and the page will refresh.,But this is generally not what we want to happen in React.,We want to prevent this default behavior and let React control the form.,Handling forms is about how you handle the data when it changes value or gets 
submitted.,In HTML, form data is usually handled by the DOM.,In React, form data is usually handled by the components.,When the data is handled by the components, all the data is stored in the component

this tutorial we will concentrate on Function components.,When creating a React component, the component's name , start with an 
upper case letter.,A class component must include the , statement. 
This statement creates an inheritance to React.Component, and gives your component access to React.Component's functions.,The component also requires a , method,

component gets initiated.,The constructor function is where you initiate the component's properties.,In React, component properties should be kept in an object called
,.,You will learn more about , later in 
this tutorial.,The constructor function is also where you honor the inheritance of the 
parent component by including the , 
statement, which executes the parent component's constructor function, and your component has access to all the functions of 
the parent component (,).,Use the color property in the render() function:,Another way of handling component properties is by using ,.,Props are like function arguments, and you send them into the component as attributes.,You will learn more about , in the next chapter.,If your component has a constructor function,
the props should always be passed to the constructor and also to the React.Component via the , method.,We can refer to components inside other components:,React is all about re-using code, and it can be smart to insert some of your 
components in separate files.,To do that, create a new file with a , 
file extension and put the code inside it:,Note that the file must start by importing React (as before), and it has to 
end with the statement ,.,To be able to use the , component, you have to import the file in your 
application.,React Class components have a built-in , object.,You might have noticed that we used , earlier in the component constructor section.,The , object is where you store property values that belongs to the component.,When the , object changes, the component re-renders.,The state object is initialized in the constructor:,The state object can contain as many properties as you like:,Refer to the , object anywhere in the component by using the
, syntax:,To change a value in the state object, use the , method.,When a value in the , object changes, 
the component will re-render, meaning that the output will change according to 
the new value(s).,Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its 
three main phases.,The three phases are: ,, ,, and
,.,Mounting means putting elements into the DOM.,React has four built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when 
mounting a component:,The , method is required and will 
always be called, the others are optional and will be called if you define them.,The , method is called before anything else, 
when the component is initiated, and it is the natural 
place to set up the initial , and other 
initial values.,The , method is called with the 
,, as arguments, and you should always 
start by calling the , before 
anything else, this will initiate the parent's constructor method and allows the 
component to inherit methods from its parent (,).,The , method is 
called right before rendering the element(s) in the DOM.,This is the natural place to set the , object based on the initial 
,.
,It takes , as an argument, and returns an object with changes to the
,.,The example below starts with the favorite color being 
""red"", but the
, method updates the favorite color based on the
, attribute:,The , method is required, and is the 
method that actually outputs the HTML to the DOM.,The , method is called after the 
component is rendered.,This is where you run statements that requires that the component is already placed in the DOM.,The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is ,.,A component is updated whenever there is a change in the component's
, or ,.,React has five built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when a component 
is updated:,The , method is required and will 
always be called, the others are optional and will be called if you define them.,Also at , the , method is 
called. This is the first method that is called when a component gets updated.,This is still the natural place to set the , object based on the initial props.


,The example below has a button that changes the favorite color to blue, but 
since the , method is called, 
which updates the state with the color from the favcol attribute, the favorite color is 
still 
rendered as yellow:,In the , method
you can return a Boolean value that specifies whether React should continue with the rendering or not.,The default value is ,.,The example below shows what happens when the , method returns ,:,The , method is of course called when a component gets ,, 
it has to re-render the HTML to the DOM, with the new changes.,The example below has a button that changes the favorite color to blue:,In the , method
you have access to the , and 
, , the update, meaning that 
even after the update, you can check what the values were , the 
update.,If the , method
is present, you should also include the , method, otherwise you will get an error.,The example below might seem complicated, but all it does is this:,When the component is , it is rendered with the favorite 
color ""red"".,When the component , a timer changes the state, and 
after one second, the favorite color becomes ""yellow"".,This action triggers the , phase, and since this component has a , method, this method is executed, and writes a 
message to the empty DIV1 element.,Then the , method is 
executed and writes a message in the empty DIV2 element:, ,The , method
is called after the component is updated in the DOM.,The example below might seem complicated, but all it does is this:,When the component is , it is rendered with the favorite 
color ""red"".,When the component , a timer changes the state, and 
the color becomes ""yellow"".,This action triggers the , phase, and since this component has 
a , method, this method is 
executed and writes a message in the empty DIV element:,The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is removed from the DOM, or , as React likes to call it.,React has only one built-in method that gets called when a component is unmounted:,The , method is 
called when the component is about to be removed from the DOM.",,,
