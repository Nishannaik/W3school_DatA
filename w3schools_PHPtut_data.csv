PHP ,Forms - Required Fields,"PHP - Required Fields,PHP - Display The Error Messages",Example,"This chapter shows how to make input fields required and create error messages if needed.,From the validation rules table on the previous page, we see that the ""Name"", ""E-mail"", and 
""Gender"" fields are required. These fields cannot be empty and must be filled out in the 
HTML form.,In the previous chapter, all input fields were optional. ,In the following code we have added some new variables: $nameErr, $emailErr, 
$genderErr, and $websiteErr. These error variables will hold error messages for the 
required fields. We have also added an , statement for each $_POST variable. This 
checks if the $_POST variable is empty (with the PHP , 
function). If it is empty, an error message is stored in the different error variables, 
and if it is not empty, it sends the user input data through the , 
function:,Then in the HTML form, we add a little script after each required field, 
which generates the correct error message if needed (that is if the user tries to submit 
the form without filling out the required fields):,The next step is to validate the input data, that is ""Does the Name field 
contain only letters and whitespace?"", and ""Does the E-mail field contain a 
valid e-mail address syntax?"", and if filled out, ""Does the Website field contain 
a valid URL?"".",,,
PHP ,Form Validation,"PHP Form Validation,Text Fields,Radio Buttons,The Form Element,Big Note on PHP Form Security,How To Avoid $_SERVER[""PHP_SELF""] Exploits?,Validate Form Data With PHP",Example,"This and the next chapters show how to use PHP to validate form data.,The HTML form we will be working at in these chapters, contains various input fields: 
required and optional text fields, radio buttons, and a submit button:,The validation rules for the form above are as follows:,First we will look at the plain HTML code for the form:,The name, email, and website fields are text input elements, and the comment 
field is a textarea. The HTML code looks like this:,The gender fields are radio buttons and the HTML code looks like this:,The HTML code of the form looks like this:,When the form is submitted, the form data is sent with method=""post"".,So, the $_SERVER[""PHP_SELF""] sends the submitted form data to the page itself, instead of jumping to a different page. 
This way, the user will get error messages on the same page as the form.,The $_SERVER[""PHP_SELF""] variable can be used by hackers!,If PHP_SELF is used in your page then a user can enter a slash (/) and then
some Cross Site Scripting (XSS) commands to execute.,Assume we have the following form in a page named ""test_form.php"":,Now, if a user enters the normal URL in the address bar like 
""http://www.example.com/test_form.php"", the above code will be translated to:,So far, so good.,However, consider that a user enters the following URL in the address bar:,In this case, the above code will be translated to:,This code adds a script tag and an alert command. And when the page loads, the 
JavaScript code will be executed (the user will see an alert box). This is just a simple 
and harmless example how the PHP_SELF variable can be exploited.,Be aware of that ,A hacker can redirect the user to a file on another server, 
and that file can hold malicious code 
that can alter the global variables or submit the form to another 
address to save the user data, for example.,$_SERVER[""PHP_SELF""] exploits can be avoided by using the htmlspecialchars() function.,The form code should look like this:,The htmlspecialchars() function converts special characters to HTML entities. Now if the user 
tries to exploit the PHP_SELF variable, it will result in the following output:,The exploit attempt fails, and no harm is done!,The first thing we will do is to pass all variables through PHP's htmlspecialchars() function.,When we use the htmlspecialchars() function; then if a user tries to submit the following in a text field:,<script>location.href('http://www.hacked.com')</script>,- this would not be executed, because it would be saved as HTML escaped code, like this:,&lt;script&gt;location.href('http://www.hacked.com')&lt;/script&gt;,The code is now safe to be displayed on a page or inside an e-mail.,We will also do two more things when the user submits the form:,The next step is to create a function that will do all the checking for us 
(which is much more convenient than writing the same code over and over again).,We will name the function test_input().,Now, we can 
check each $_POST variable with the test_input() function, and the script looks like this:,Notice that at the start of the script, we check whether the form has been 
submitted using $_SERVER[""REQUEST_METHOD""]. If the REQUEST_METHOD is POST, then 
the form has been submitted - and it 
should be validated. If it has not been submitted, skip the validation and 
display a blank form.,However, in the example above, all input fields are optional. The script 
works fine even if the user does not enter any data.,The next step is to make input fields required and create error messages if 
needed.",,,
PHP ,File Handling,"PHP Manipulating Files,PHP readfile() Function,PHP Exercises",Example,"File handling is an important part of any web application. You 
often need to open and process a file for different tasks.,PHP has several functions for creating, reading, uploading, and editing files.,The , function reads a file and writes it to the output buffer.,Assume we have a text file called ""webdictionary.txt"", stored on the 
server, that looks like this:,The PHP code to read the file and write it to the output buffer is as follows

we add a little PHP script inside the value attribute of the following input 
fields: name, email, and website. In the comment textarea field, we put the 
script between the <textarea> and </textarea> tags. The little script outputs the 
value of the $name, $email, $website, and $comment variables. ,Then, we also need to show which radio button that was checked. For this, we

the HTTP POST method.,To display the submitted data you could simply echo all the variables. The ""welcome.php"" looks like this:,The output could be something like this:,The same result could also be achieved using the HTTP GET method:,and ""welcome_get.php"" looks like this:,The code above is quite simple. However, the most important thing is missing. You need 
to validate form data to protect your script from malicious code.,Both GET and POST create an array (e.g. array( key1 => value1, 
key2 => value2, key3 => value3, ...)). This array holds key/value pairs, where 
keys are the names of the form controls and values are the input data from the user.,Both GET and POST are treated as $_GET and $_POST. These are superglobals, 
which means that they are always accessible, regardless of scope - and you can access them from any function,
class or file without having to do anything special.,$_GET is an array of variables passed to the current script via the URL parameters.,$_POST is an array of variables passed to the current script via the HTTP POST method.,Information sent from a form with the GET method is , (all 
variable names and values are displayed in the URL). GET also has limits on the amount of 
information to send. The limitation is about 2000 characters. However, 
because the variables are displayed in the URL, it is possible to bookmark the 
page. This can be useful in some cases.,GET may be used for sending non-sensitive data., GET should NEVER be used for sending passwords or other sensitive information!,Information sent from a form with the POST method is ,

and , is a ,that makes the search case-insensitive.,The delimiter can be any character that is not a letter, number, backslash or space. The
most common delimiter is the forward slash (/), but when your pattern contains forward
slashes it is convenient to choose other delimiters such as # or ~.,PHP provides a variety of functions that allow you to use regular expressions. The

server executes it), with the include or require statement.,So, if you want the execution to go on and show users the output, even if the 
include file is missing, use the include statement. Otherwise, in case of FrameWork, CMS, or a 
complex PHP application coding, always use the require statement to include a key file to the 
flow of execution. This will help avoid compromising your application's security 
and integrity, just in-case one key file is accidentally missing.,Including files saves a lot of work. This means that 
you can create a standard header, footer, or menu file for all your web pages. 
Then, when the header needs to be updated, you can only

a script, to perform

,.,Besides the built-in PHP functions, it is possible to create your own functions.,A user-defined function declaration starts with the word ,:, Give the function a name that reflects what the 
function does!,In the example below, we create a function named ""writeMsg()"". The opening 
curly brace ( { ) indicates the beginning of the function code, and the closing 
curly brace ( } ) indicates the end of the function. The function outputs ""Hello 
world!"". To call the function, just write its name followed by brackets ():,Information can be passed to functions through arguments. An argument is just 
like a variable.,Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. You 
can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma. ,The following example has a function with one argument ($fname). When the 
familyName() function is called, we also pass along a name (e.g. Jani), and the 
name is used inside the function, which outputs several different first names, 
but an equal last name:,The following example has a function with two arguments ($fname and $year):,In the example above, notice that we did not have to tell PHP which data type the variable is.,PHP automatically associates a data type to the variable, depending on its value. 
Since the data types are not set in a strict sense, you can do things like 
adding a string to an integer without causing an error.,In PHP 7, type declarations were added. This gives us an option to specify 
the expected data type when declaring a function, and by adding the , 
declaration, it will throw a ""Fatal 
Error"" if the data type mismatches.,In the following example we try to send both a number and a string to the 
function without using ,:,To specify , we need to set ,. 
This must be on the very first line of the PHP file.,In the following example we try to send both a number and a string to the 
function, but here we have added the , 
declaration:,The following example shows how to use a default parameter. If we call the 
function setHeight() without arguments it takes the default value as argument:,To let a function return a value, use the , statement:,PHP 7 also supports Type Declarations for the , 
statement. Like with the type declaration for function arguments, by enabling the strict requirement, it will throw a ""Fatal 
Error"" on a type mismatch.,To declare a type for the function return, add a colon (
, ) and the type right before the opening curly 
( , )bracket when declaring the function.,In the following example we specify the return type for the function:,You can specify a different return type, than the argument types, but make 
sure the return is the correct type:,In PHP, arguments are usually passed by value, which means that a copy of the value is
used in the function and the variable that was passed into the function cannot be changed.,When a function argument is passed by reference, changes to the argument also change
the variable that was passed in. To turn a function argument into a reference, the ,
operator is used:","A function is a block of statements that can be used repeatedly in a program.,A function will not execute automatically when a page loads.,A function will be executed by a call to the function.",,

PHP - AJAX ,Introduction,"What is AJAX?,How AJAX Works,AJAX is Based on Internet Standards,Google Suggest,Start Using AJAX Today",,"AJAX is about updating parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.,AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.,AJAX is a technique for creating fast and dynamic web pages.,AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging small 
amounts of data with the server behind the scenes. This means that it is 
possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.,Classic web pages, (which do not use AJAX) must reload the entire page if the 
content should change.,Examples of applications using AJAX: Google Maps, Gmail, Youtube, and 
Facebook tabs.,AJAX is based on internet standards, and uses a combination of:,AJAX was made popular in 2005 by Google, with Google Suggest., 
is using AJAX to create a very dynamic web interface: 
When you start typing in Google's search box, a JavaScript sends the letters off 
to a server and the server returns a list of suggestions.,In our PHP tutorial, we will demonstrate how AJAX can update parts of a web 
page, without reloading the whole page. The server script will be written in PHP.,If you want to learn more about AJAX, visit our ,.","XMLHttpRequest object (to exchange data asynchronously with a server),JavaScript/DOM (to display/interact with the information),CSS (to style the data),XML (often used as the format for transferring data)",,

defined with the same name, and the same or a less restricted access modifier. 
So, if the abstract method is defined as protected, the child class method must

arguments in addition.,So, when a child class is inherited from an abstract class, we have the following rules:,Let's look at an example:,The Audi, Volvo, and Citroen classes are inherited from the Car class. This means that the 
Audi, Volvo, and Citroen classes can use the public $name 
property as well as the public __construct() method from the 
Car class because of inheritance.,But, intro() is an abstract method that should be defined in all the child

PHP ,Sessions,"What is a PHP Session?,Start a PHP Session,Get PHP Session Variable Values,Modify a PHP Session Variable,Destroy a PHP Session ,PHP Exercises","Example,Example,Example,Example,Example","A session is a way to store information (in variables) to be used across multiple pages.,Unlike a cookie, the information is not stored on the users computer.,When you work with an application, you open it, do some changes, and 
then you close it. This is much like a Session. The computer knows who you are. 
It knows when you start the application and when you end. But on the internet 
there is one problem: the web server does not know who you are or what you do, 
because the HTTP address doesn't maintain state.,Session variables solve this problem by storing user information 
to be used across multiple pages (e.g. username, favorite color, etc). By 
default, session variables last until the user closes the browser.,So; Session variables hold information about one single user, and are available to all pages in one application.,A session is started with the , function.,Session variables are set with the PHP global variable: $_SESSION.,Now, let's create a new page called ""demo_session1.php"". In this page, we start a 
new PHP session and set some session variables:,Next, we create another page called ""demo_session2.php"". From this page, we 
will access the session information we set on the first page (""demo_session1.php"").,Notice that session variables are not passed individually to each new page, 
instead they are retrieved from the session we open at the beginning of each 
page (,).,Also notice that all session variable values are stored in the global $_SESSION variable:,Another way to show all the session variable values for a user session is to run the

A cookie is a small file that the 
server embeds on the user's computer. Each time the same computer requests a 
page with a browser, it will send the cookie too. With PHP, you can both create 
and retrieve cookie values.,A cookie is created with the , function.,Only the , parameter is required. All other parameters are 
optional.,The following example creates a cookie named ""user"" with the value ""John 
Doe"". The cookie will expire after 30 days (86400 * 30). The ""/"" means that the 
cookie is available in entire website (otherwise, select the directory you 
prefer).,We then retrieve the value of the cookie ""user"" (using the global variable 
$_COOKIE). We also use the , function to find out if the cookie is set:, The value of the cookie is automatically URLencoded when 
sending the cookie, and automatically decoded when received (to prevent 
URLencoding, use , instead).,To modify a cookie, just set (again) the cookie using the , function:,To delete a cookie, use the , function with an expiration date in

Number Strings.,One thing to notice about PHP is that it provides automatic data type 
conversion.,So, if you assign an integer value to a variable, the type of that variable 
will automatically be an integer. Then, if you assign a string to 
the same variable, the type will change to a string.,This automatic conversion can sometimes break your code.,2, 256, -256, 10358, -179567 are all integers.,An integer is a number without any decimal part.,An integer data type is a non-decimal number between -2147483648 and 
2147483647 in 32 bit systems, and between -9223372036854775808 and 
9223372036854775807 in 64 bit systems. A value greater (or lower) than this, will be stored as float, 
because it exceeds the limit of an integer., Another important thing to know is that even if 4 * 2.5 is 10, the result is 
stored as float, because one of the operands is a float (2.5).,Here are some rules for integers:,PHP has the following predefined constants for integers:,PHP has the following functions to check if the type of a variable is 
integer:,A float is a number with a decimal point or a number in exponential form.,2.0, 256.4, 10.358, 7.64E+5, 5.56E-5 are all floats.,The float data type can commonly store a value up to 1.7976931348623E+308

behaviors from the class, but each object will have different values for the 
properties.,Let's assume we have a class named Car. A Car can have properties like model, 
color, etc. We can define variables like $model, $color, and so on, to hold the 
values of these properties.,When the individual objects (Volvo, BMW, Toyota, etc.) are created, they 
inherit all the properties and behaviors from the class, but each object will 
have different values for the properties.,If you create a __construct() function, PHP will automatically call this 
function when you create an object from a class.,Null is a special data type which can have only one value: NULL.,A variable of data type NULL is a variable that has no value assigned to it., If a variable is created without a value, it is 
automatically assigned a value of NULL.,Variables can also be emptied by setting the value to NULL:,The special resource type is not an actual data type. It is the storing of a
