based on how well the line fits a plot.,The way to compute this error, is to loop through all (x,y) points in the plot,
and sum the square distances between the y value of each point and the line.,The most conventional way is to square the distances (to ensure positive values)
and to make the error function differentiable.,We will now run a gradient descent.,The gradient descent algorithm should walk the cost function towards the best line.,Each iteration should update both m and b towards a line with a lower cost (error).,To do that, we add a train function that loops over all the data many times:,The train function above should update the weights and biases in each iteration.,The direction to move is calculated using two partial derivatives:"," is the error (cost), is the total number of observations (points), is the value (label) of each observation, is the value (feature) of each observation, is the slope (weight), is intercept (bias), is the prediction, is the squared mean value","

It is a , system:,
1,5 means 1 times 60, plus 5 (65),
3,30 means 3 times 60, plus 30 (180 + 30 = 210),
,The Babylonians had a place-value system, where the digits to
in the left represented full values, much like our decimal system.,The reason why the Babylonians used 60 as the base,
was (we like to believe) that 60 is divisible with most numbers:
1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30, and 60.,The downside was that the user had to remember
60 different digits. But the system was smart. A lot of it is still in use today:,The origin of the , (base 60) has been lost in history.,But surely, it looks like it has been used in parallel with the , since ancient times.,The dozenal system (base 12):,12 is very versatile. It can be divided by 1,2,3,4,6,and 12.,Each of your fingers have 3 joints:,The sexagesimal system (base 60):,60 is very versatile. It can be divided by 1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,30, and 60.,Roman numbers originated in Rome and was used in Europe into the Middle Ages.,The Romans used a , system.
Possibly because they used their 10 fingers to count.,Today, most of the world use a , number system:,
Western numbers, Chinese numbers, Brahmi numbers, Greek numbers, Hebrew numbers...,
5 means 5,
50 means 5 times 10,

The topic is difficult to study because of the lack of evidence.,We don't know how it started. But we have a clue.,The great African apes, Pan and Gorilla, are our closest living relatives.
Why are they called ""Apes""? Because they ape. Apes mime to get their message across.,It is assumed that the evolution of languages must have been a long process.
